    <b>Note:</b>&nbsp; Telemetry documentation for this specific Lunar
    Module software version is not (yet) available, most likely due to
    an unavailable <i>Guidance System Operations Plan</i> (GSOP) for
    it.&nbsp; The documentation herein is based on assumptions about the
    contents of the unavailable GSOP documents, so do not assume that it
    is perfectly reliable.&nbsp; Careful examination of the source code
    for the AGC software version, if available, may provide additional
    detail in resolving questions; refer particularly to source-code
    files with names such as:

    <p>CSM STATE VECTOR and TIME.&nbsp; The LGC's latest calculated
      state vector for the CSM in reference coordinates.&nbsp; The
      coordinates may be either earth-centered or moon-centered; a zero
      in bit 12 of flagword 8 (CMOONFLG) indicates earth-centered, a one
      indicates moon-centered.&nbsp; Words 2-4 contain the position
      components X, Y, Z scaled meters/2<sup>29</sup>.&nbsp; Words 5-7
      contain the velocity components X, Y, Z scaled
      (meters/centisecond)/2<sup>7</sup>.&nbsp; Word 8 contains the time
      associated with the state vector scaled centimeters/2<sup>28</sup>,
      referenced to the computer clock.&nbsp; The scaling for position,
      velocity and time is the same whether earth-centered or
      moon-centered. <br>

    K-FACTOR.&nbsp; The ground elapsed time of the zero reference time
    of the Abort Guidance System (AGS).&nbsp; It is set only by the AGS
    Initialization Routine (R47).&nbsp; Calculated on the first use of
    R47 and on subsequent calls to R47 if requested by the

    <p>POSTORKU.&nbsp; Running sum of positive torque commands about

      used).&nbsp; POSTORKU will, in time, overflow and subsequently
      increase once more from zero (overflow does not go into sign
      bit).&nbsp; The scaling is such as to preclude more than one
      overflow per downlink cycle (2 sec) thus making the change from
      one reading to the next unambiguous. &nbsp; Calculated every 0.1
      second when DAP is running.&nbsp; Scaled jetseconds/32 (1
      jetsecond is defined as 1 jet firing for 1 second). </p>

    AOT CODE is the erasable storage for Display Nouns 70 and 71 in the
    routines AOTMARK (R53), Auto Optics Positioning (R52), and Star
    Acquisition (R59).&nbsp; AOTCODE is always equal to the data keyed
    in by the astronaut under Nouns 70 and 71 except during R59 where
    the detent code in bits 9-7 is computed to reflect the azimuth
    position code in R3 under the display V06 N79.

            LAMBERT) whenever INITVEL is called with a (true or offset)
            target vector which lies inside "the cone"; reset to 0 by
            INITVEL whenever INITVEL is called with a (true or offset)
            target vector which lies outside "the cone".&nbsp; ("The
            cone" is a mathematically-defined cone whose vertex is the
            origin of coordinates, whose axis is the 180° transfer
            direction, and whose semi-cone angle is specified to
            INITVEL.)&nbsp; The semi-cone angle is set to 15° by P34,
            P35, P74 and P75 because active vehicle transfer angles
            between 165° and 195° are normally avoided in the targeting
            procedure.&nbsp; However, if a transfer angle falling within
            this 180° ± 15° sector is intentionally selected by one of
            the targeting programs (P34 or P74), or results from one of
            the maneuver programs (P35 or P75) during an intercept
            trajectory targeted for more than 180°, the Lambert Aim
            Point Maneuver Prethrust Routine increases the semi-cone
            angle to 45° so that active vehicle transfer angle will not
            change from inside to outside the cone angle during the
            powered maneuver.&nbsp; Such a condition is undesirable
            since the intercept trajectory would be retargeted during
            the powered maneuver.&nbsp; Likewise, if the initial
            transfer central angle falls outside the 15° semi-cone
            angle, the semi-cone angle is decreased to 10° to reduce the
            possibility of a transfer angle changing from outside to
            inside the cone during a powered maneuver.&nbsp; NORMSW
            should generally remain 0, unless transfers between 165° and
            195° are intended.&nbsp; NORMSW is equivalent to the switch

              source.&nbsp; If multiple restarts occur, more than one
              bit could possibly be left set afterwards (i.e., if they

    <p>R3D1 stands for digit one of the third register and VD1 stand for
      the first digit of the verb display, etc.&nbsp; For the right
      character of a pair, bit 5 is the MSB with bit 1 the LSB.&nbsp;
      For the left character of a pair, the MSB is bit 10 with bit 6 the
      LSB.&nbsp; Bit 11 of some of the DSPTABs contains discrete
      information, a one indicating that the discrete is on.&nbsp; For
      example, a one in bit 11 of DSPTAB+1 indicates that R3 has a plus
      sign.&nbsp; If the sign bits associated with a given register are
      both zeros, then the content of that particular register is octal;
      if either of the bits is set, the register content is decimal
      data.</p>
    <p>The five bit codes associated with the digits are as follows:<br>

    If bits 15 through 12 of DSPTAB+11D are 1000, the last 11 bits
    indicate the state to which the LGC will command the relays; if bits
    15 through 12 are 0000, the last 11 bits indicate the actual state
    of the relays.&nbsp; A one indicates that the discrete is on.
