            <ul>
              <li>I realize belatedly that I've been handling fixes to
                Virtual AGC stupidly.&nbsp; There's a problem-reporting
                system associated with our GitHub repository, but if
                someone has directly reported a problem to me I've just
                tried to handle it directly with them, and if that's
                successful there's never any problem report
                generated.&nbsp; Why that's dumb is that since there's
                no paper trail on it, there's no good way for anyone to
                know what problems have been fixed in what revisions of
                Virtual AGC, or even if they've been fixed at all, and
                hence no way for them to know if it's worth updating
                their Virtual AGC installation.&nbsp; Even I don't know,
                half of the time.&nbsp; D'oh!&nbsp; <a
                  moz-do-not-send="true"
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues">Please

                  create problem reports</a>, even if you're going to
                communicate with me directly.&nbsp; If you don't, then
                I'll have to do it for you, and I'm really lazy so I
                don't want to!&nbsp; For myself, I'll try to make a
                better effort on this, until it loses its urgency and I
                forget all about it.</li>
              <li>I realized this while dealing with problems reported
                directly to me that the <b>LM_Simulator</b> component
                of Virtual AGC doesn't work in the latest version of
                Tcl/Tk, and that Tcl/Tk doesn't work at all in any
                recent version of Mac OS.&nbsp; While researching the
                fixes that had to be made, I realized I had no way to
                backtrack through earlier versions of Tcl/Tk to see if
                my fixes would break LM_Simulator in them or not.&nbsp;
                It's not the same thing as the problem-reporting issue
                in Virtual AGC, of course, but it pointed a big "<i>j'excuse!</i>"
                finger directly at me anyway.&nbsp; Speaking of which,
                issues <a moz-do-not-send="true"

                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues/1235">#1235</a>
                (the Tcl/Tk/Mac OS problems just mentioned) have been
                dealt with, and you should check them out if you've
                experienced either problem.&nbsp; Not only that, but it
                turns out that up to now the installation instructions
                for Windows haven't mentioned that Tcl/Tk needs to be
                installed (issue <a moz-do-not-send="true"
                  href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/issues/1237">#1237</a>).&nbsp;
                So that's fixed too.</li>

            is.&nbsp; After all, if you're interested you can look at

            about the notion right now, so I can't help it.<br>

                contrast to the Saturn IB EDD already in our
                library.&nbsp; Apollo 4 was the very first Saturn V
                mission, so I suppose we can expect that the EDD had a
                few teething difficulties.&nbsp; For example, <a

              <li> Having had the chance to look at it in some detail
                after mostly ignoring it for a long time, I have come to
                realize that Virtual AGC's installation instructions and
                graphical-interface applications (such as the simulated
                DSKY and the telemetry monitor) had rotted somewhat over
                time.&nbsp; While still mostly functional, they had
                nevertheless degraded from "acceptable" to "positively
                crummy".&nbsp; This was partially due to neglect on my
                part.&nbsp; But it was also partially due to the
                relentless march of time, over the course of which
                operating systems had evolved, and software libraries
                which I had depended upon had been obsoleted and
                replaced by other versions of those libraries that
                didn't work quite the same way.&nbsp; Then too, there
                was the availability of 4K displays for desktop systems,
                with the consequence that software not prepared for 4K
                had acquired very, very tiny user interfaces.&nbsp; The
                upshot of all this is that I have spent a fair amount of
                time revising all of the graphical user interface (GUI)
                code for Virtual AGC programs, so that these programs
                now look fine on all of the Linux/Mac/Windows systems to
                which I have access, with either "normal" or 4K
                displays.&nbsp; To support the possibility of high-DPI
                displays, these programs now all rely upon a new <a
                  moz-do-not-send="true" href="download.html#4K">environment







                  variable (AGC_SCALE)</a> which can be assigned a
                number such as 1.5 or 2.0, the default being 1.0, by
                which the sizes of all of the Virtual AGC user
                interfaces are new automatically scaled.&nbsp; The same
                scale is applied to all Virtual AGC programs, but
                doesn't affect any non-Virtual-AGC programs. </li>
              <li>Another thing is the <a moz-do-not-send="true"

                done back in 2018 or 2019, KiCad v.5 was still a new
                thing, whereas nowadays KiCad v.8 is current and v.9 is
                in development ... but the format for the schematic
                files was 100% changed at v.6.&nbsp; While the new
                versions of KiCad can still read my old v.5
                transcriptions and convert them to the new format, as
                always with these things the conversion isn't guaranteed
                to be 100% perfect.&nbsp; Mostly; but not quite.&nbsp;
                So I've put in quite a bit of work — recall, or be
                informed, that there are about 140 transcribed drawings,
                most of them with multiple sheets — doing the manual
                adjustments to make sure those conversions are indeed
                exactly right after all!</li>
              <li>And then there's our <a moz-do-not-send="true"
                  href="Verilog.html">Verilog-based digital simulation
                  of the AGC electronics</a>, based on the CAD
                transcriptions I just mentioned.&nbsp; Well, it turns
                out that the Python scripts used to process the
                schematics in order to produce the needed Verilog
                source-code files don't understand the new format of
                KiCad's schematic files!&nbsp; So Verilog simulations
                will be on hold for a while until I fix up those Python
                scripts.&nbsp; Hopefully that'll be in the
                not-too-distant future, but I haven't started on it yet.</li>
              <li>And speaking of Python scripts, most of our Python
                scripts are written for Python 3, but a few older
                scripts based on Python 2 have persisted, since it has
                always been possible to install both Python 3 and Python
                2 on your computer and have them coexist in
                harmony.&nbsp; Or rather, it <i>had been</i> possible
                to do that until recently.&nbsp; Some newer operating
                systems like Ubuntu 24 not only don't install Python 2
                in their default configuration, but don't allow you to
                install Python 2 at all, not even as an option.&nbsp; Or
                at least not without circumventing the steps they've
                taken to stop you from doing it, and thus taking the
                chance of breaking your system in the process.&nbsp;
                Apparently, that lack of Python 2 bothers nobody but
                oddballs like me.&nbsp; The bottom line is that all
                Python 2 scripts in Virtual AGC have to be converted to
                Python 3.&nbsp; I've done some of them so far.&nbsp;
                Others will take longer.</li>
              <li> And yet one more thing!&nbsp; Eight or nine years
                ago, tired of supporting all of these various computer
                platforms (Windows, Mac OS, FreeBSD, Solaris, ...) which
                I never use personally if I can help it, I got the
                bright idea of dropping direct support for them, but
                instead providing Virtual AGC as a virtual machine (VM)
                that could be downloaded and run in hypervisors such as
                VirtualBox on any of these platforms.&nbsp; And the VM
                worked great, I think.&nbsp; Unfortunately, after some
                point I stupidly forgot to continue providing updated
                versions of Virtual AGC for that VM.&nbsp; Yikes!&nbsp;
                So the VM had become very out-of-date.&nbsp; Not only
                that, but I've also found that since it was now based on
                such an old operating system (32-bit Ubuntu 14.04), I no
                longer <i>could</i> update Virtual AGC for the VM even
                if I got my motivational ducks in a row.&nbsp; Virtual
                AGC simply requires a more-modern environment than
                10-year-old 32-bit Ubuntu in the old VM to build and
                run.&nbsp; Solution?&nbsp; A new VM!&nbsp; I've replaced
                that old VM with a completely new feature-packed VM that
                not only has more capabilities, but also by design can
                be very-easily updated <i>without</i> my having had to
                prepare such updates for them in advance!&nbsp; In other
                words, users of the new VM will be protected from my
                future indolence after this burst of energy on my part
                has dissipated.&nbsp; The key is that the new VM doubles
                as a very stable build machine for Virtual AGC, a
                capability which the old VM did not have, due to having
                been pared down to its bare essentials.&nbsp; <a
                  moz-do-not-send="true" href="download.html">All of
                  this stuff is thoroughly written up on a
                  completely-revised and simplified download page</a>,
                which has thrown out almost all of the old, useless
                stuff that's no longer supported, while hopefully better
                illustrating the use of the new.&nbsp; <br>
              </li>
              <li>An added bonus is that the download page now includes
                something lacking up to now, namely <a
                  moz-do-not-send="true" href="download.html#Sequoia">build-instructions







                  for Virtual AGC on Mac OS Sequoia that will (probably)
                  work with any other recent versions of Mac OS</a> too.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Another way of looking at most of the mumbo-jumbo above
              is that I want the new VM to be as perfect as humanly
              possible, and to provide as much of the Virtual AGC
              functionality that I enjoy on my own computer as it
              possibly can, <i>without</i> any of the hassle on users'
              parts that I have to endure for myself.&nbsp; And to do
              that, I had to make sure that everything in Virtual AGC
              that was no longer up to my standards (as minimal as you
              may think them) was perfected at the same time.&nbsp; The
              extent to which I've succeeded is always debatable, I
              suppose, but I'm very pleased with the result.<br>

            significance that anybody would be tempted to rebuild the
            entire system just to get those improvements!&nbsp; The
            most-visible improvement is that the various visual
            components of the simulation (DSKY, DEDA, Telemetry, ...)
            are now spread across the desktop for maximum visibility
            rather than being piled atop each other so that you're

            probably contributed somewhat to people's desires to create

            Personally, I've been mostly occupied the last few months
            with the AP-101 assembler for the space shuttle flight
            software, as I mentioned in a previous posting.&nbsp;
            There's light at the end of the tunnel on that now, though
            the assembler itself is not <i>quite</i> ready for prime
            time yet.<br>
            <br>
            At some point, an AP-101 linker will have to be written to
            combine the object-code files produced by the HAL/S compiler
            and the AP-101 assembler into executable AP-101 load
            files.&nbsp; Frankly, I have no enthusiasm nor relevant
            experience or knowledge for writing the linker myself.&nbsp;
            I <i>have</i> documented the reverse engineering about
            AP-101 object files (<a moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="HALLINK101S.html">here</a>), since understanding
            that format is a necessary step not only for writing a
            linker, but for writing the assembler as well.&nbsp; If
            there's anyone interesting in shouldering the burden of
            writing an AP-101 linker, drop me a line.<br>

              href="Documents/Saturn%20V%20Step-by-Step%20Final.pdf">Saturn


















              V Step-by-Step</a>", written by himself (thanks, Mark!),
            which I've posted to the document library.&nbsp; It's based
            on the very interesting notion of a complete timeline —
            within the limits of reason — of the "life" of a Saturn V
            rocket, with the Apollo 11 mission as the baseline but with
            notable events from other missions described as well.&nbsp;
            The first events on the timeline are the CM system tests,
            about 9 months prior to launch, while the final event is the
            S-IVB impact on the lunar surface.&nbsp; But just saying
            that doesn't do much justice to the level of detail.&nbsp;
            Some events I noticed, for example, include the specific
            programs running on the AGC and the time at which the LVDC
            is shut down.&nbsp; There's about 70 pages of timeline
            overall.<br>
            <br>
            The document isn't actually a great fit for the Virtual AGC
            library, simply because we only provide archival documents
            that are unchanging and can be preserved as-is for
            eternity.&nbsp; Whereas Mark's document will presumably
            change over time, and our library isn't really set up for
            the possibility that documents are evolving on an ongoing
            basis.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Mark wanted to provide it to the
            world, in a way that could allow him to get some expert
            feedback on it, and posting it seemed to be the most
            straightforward means at <i>my</i> disposal to help with
            that.&nbsp; Alas, I cannot provide any useful feedback
            myself, since I'm not an expert on the Saturn rocket in any
            sense, but I know that some of you are. <br>

            <br>
            A couple of weeks ago I reported that the HAL/S compiler for
            the Space Shuttle's flight software had reached at least a
            preliminary level of usability.&nbsp; But I also mentioned
            that to be really useful, you'd also need a linker for IBM
            AP-101S object files and an emulator for the AP-101S
            CPU.&nbsp; (Recall that the Space Shuttle's "general purpose
            computers" were IBM model AP-101B at first, and then later
            on were model AP-101S.)&nbsp; What I <i>failed</i> to
            mention is that in addition to source code in the HAL/S
            higher-level language, there's also a lot of Shuttle flight
            software written in AP-101 assembly language, and thus you'd
            also need an AP-101 assembler in addition to the HAL/S
            compiler.<br>
            <br>
            Well, given that I've written assemblers for the Apollo AGC,
            AGC, and LVDC, I thought I could knock out an AP-101B/S
            assembler in short order.<br>
            <br>
            Wrong!&nbsp; Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!<br>
            <br>
            While no documentation for the AP-101B/S assembler has
            survived (let alone its source code!), in so far as I'm
            aware, I came to the conclusion that the assembly language
            is based very closely on IBM's assembler for System/360
            Basic Assembly Language (BAL).&nbsp; Yes, the CPU
            instructions are somewhat different, but I'm referring to
            the language syntax, pseudo-operations, and so forth.&nbsp;
            In fact, I suspect that the original AP-101 assembler was
            probably created by simply replacing the code-generation
            portions of the System/360 assembler, and leaving the
            scanning and parsing portions intact.&nbsp; That's not
            immediately helpful to <i>me</i>, of course, since I don't
            have a copy of the System/360 assembler's source code, nor
            could I use it if I had it since it would be in copyright
            limbo.&nbsp; Besides which, such an assembler would likely
            run <i>only</i> an IBM 360 or similar.&nbsp; On the other
            hand, multiple versions of the <i>documentation</i> for the
            System/360 assembler are floating around online (copyright
            or not), and can essentially be used as-is, even if we
            cannot repost copyrighted documents here at Virtual
            AGC.&nbsp; Beautiful!&nbsp; The most up-to-date version I'm
            aware of is <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_ibm360asmGLanguageRel21197201_10219231">this





















              1972 version</a>.<br>
            <br>
            The problem is that this assembly language is
            monstrous.&nbsp; Not the CPU instructions <i>per se</i>,
            but the fact that it's a <i>macro</i> language that has
            multiple characteristics that make it awful to parse.&nbsp;
            In fact, I can't get my head around how to parse it, and
            every time I do seem to do so, I realize 5 minutes later
            that I'm just kidding myself because there's some special
            case I had forgotten about or didn't know about in the first
            place invalidates whatever approach I had concocted.<br>
            <br>
            Normally, this wouldn't be terribly concerning, because
            macro features of an assembly language are often used only
            minimally, as an afterthought.&nbsp; For example, the LVDC
            assembly language (for the Apollo Saturn rocket) is a macro
            language, but a nice, gentle one, with macros seldom
            appearing in LVDC flight software.&nbsp; Not so for the
            Space Shuttle flight software!&nbsp; Its coders must have
            been steeped in System/360 assembly language lore, and used
            every feature of that macro language, everywhere.&nbsp;
            You'd be hard pressed to find a single flight-software
            assembly-language file that didn't depend intimately on its
            macros.&nbsp; Macros have to be considered right up front in
            implementing an assembler, not as an afterthought.&nbsp;
            More than half of the assembly-language manual is devoted
            just to macros.<br>
            <br>
            I'm tempted to continue this rant, but I think you get the
            idea:&nbsp; There might be some delays involved in creating
            this assembler, which by the way, I call <b>ASM101S</b>.&nbsp;





















            There's <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="ASM101S.html">a
              surprisingly-well organized page describing it</a> and
            what I'm doing it with, but who knows how long it will be
            before that page is anything other than "under construction"
            or the assembler itself is just a useless shadow of its
            final version?<br>

          <td valign="top">For quite some time now I've been working
            compilers for the HAL/S computer language.&nbsp; Indeed, for
            the last six months or so I've been working on no less than
            my <i>third</i> attempt, having abandoned the first two
            attempts when they were useful but still incomplete in one
            way or the other.&nbsp; Recall that while HAL/S is basically
            a dead language now, it is the principal language in which
            the Space Shuttle flight software was written.&nbsp; And
            while we have the source code for the original HAL/S
            compiler used for the Space Shuttle, that source code is
            written in an extended version of XPL, which itself is a
            dead computer language.&nbsp; So in order to compile the
            HAL/S compiler, I first needed to step back and write an XPL
            compiler.&nbsp; Or more accurately, a compiler for the
            extended but largely undocumented version of the XPL
            language in which the HAL/S compiler is written.<br>
            <br>
            Today, I'm announcing the first release of that XPL compiler
            (which I call <b>XCOM-I</b>) and the HAL/S compiler (which
            I call <b>HALSFC</b>), both of which can be run on Linux,
            Mac OS, or Windows.&nbsp; Their dedicated pages give
            installation and usage instructions, as well as my usual
            too-much-of-everything descriptions of what's going on:<br>
            <ul>
              <li><a moz-do-not-send="true" href="HAL.html">HALSFC page<br>

                  page</a><br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            The <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle.html">Shuttle
              page</a> has been reworked somewhat as well, to
            accommodate this new situation.<br>
            <br>
            Neither compiler is perfect, there are known bugs, and <b>HALSFC</b>
            is still missing a couple of compiler passes that deal with
            simulation data, but I'm quite pleased with both compilers
            nevertheless.<br>
            <br>
            Don't get terribly excited about this — as if anyone would!
            — until you understand the limitations.&nbsp; <b>XCOM-I</b>
            should be usable as a general XPL compiler, true; it's a
            Python program that's basically an XPL-to-C translator, so
            it can be used on any platform having Python and a
            reasonably-compatible C compiler.&nbsp; However <b>HALSFC</b>,
            while also running on Linux/Mac/Windows, nevertheless
            faithfully duplicates the functionality of the original
            HAL/S compiler.&nbsp; Which means that <b>HALSFC</b>
            outputs IBM AP-101S object-code files.&nbsp; (Recall that
            the onboard computers of the Shuttle were model
            AP-101S.)&nbsp; So unless you simply want to <i>examine</i>
            the object code created by the HAL/S compiler, you'd also
            need an AP-101S linker and emulator.&nbsp; A compiler alone
            isn't enough.&nbsp; But give us time!&nbsp; Rome wasn't
            built in a day, or even a year.<br>

            <p>Surprisingly, that's actually all tied together.&nbsp;
              The <i>reason</i> I've been too busy to look at the
              Astrionics memos I mentioned is that I've been completely
              consumed by Shuttle-related work I've been doing.&nbsp; As
              I've mentioned in other updates here, I've been working on
              a compiler (which I call XCOM-I) for the XPL programming
              language as it was extended in an undocumented fashion by
              a company called Intermetrics.&nbsp; The reason is that
              Intermetrics wrote a compiler for a computer language
              called HAL/S in this extended form of XPL.&nbsp; That
              HAL/S compiler, called HAL/S-FC, was needed to compile the
              flight software for the Space Shuttle, since that flight
              software was written in HAL/S.<br>
            </p>
            <p>And the reason I have time today for those memos is that
              just yesterday I reached a milestone on XCOM-I:&nbsp; Not
              only can it now compile HAL/S-FC, but HAL/S-FC can itself
              compile HAL/S programs, and produce object code from
              them!&nbsp; Or at least, it can compile the one HAL/S test
              program I throw at it.&nbsp; The HAL/S test program I
              throw at it is called HELLO.hal, and I'll let you guess
              what it does.&nbsp; Unfortunately, even though HAL/S-FC
              can compile HELLO.hal, what you get out of that process is
              (of course!) a program that runs <i>only</i> on one of
              the Space Shuttle's IBM AP-101S computers, not on your
              personal computer.&nbsp; And lacking any way to run
              AP-101S programs at the moment, there's therefore no way
              yet to actually run the compiled HELLO program.&nbsp; The
              same would be true, of course, if I compiled the Space
              Shuttle's flight software.&nbsp; But progress is being
              made, one step at a time!&nbsp; I'm hoping that Dan
              Weaver, who as I've mentioned before has written a <i>very</i>
              nice IBM 360 simulator, will be writing a (very similar)
              AP-101S simulator.&nbsp; At that point, we could run the
              compiled HELLO or other compiled HAL/S program and really
              start cooking!<br>
            </p>
            <p>As to why any of that is relevant, as promised, to the
              SDF-related documentation added to the Shuttle library
              today ... well, that's another mouthful-and-a-half of
              explanation.&nbsp; HAL/S-FC, the HAL/S compiler, actually
              consists of seven separate "passes" or "phases", each of
              which is a stand-alone program.&nbsp; The seven
              stand-alone programs are run in succession to perform a
              complete compilation.&nbsp; Of course, you the user don't
              really have to worry about all that nonsense if you're not
              interested in it, since you simply experience HAL/S as a
              single command, and that command worries about all of the
              details of fitting the separate passes together.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, when I say that XCOM-I can compile
              HAL/S-FC, I mean that it can compile each of the seven
              separate programs comprising HAL/S-FC.&nbsp; The AP-101S
              object code is not spit out until the fifth pass, which is
              called PASS2.&nbsp; (Go figure!)&nbsp; That leaves two
              compiler passes (called PASS3 and PASS4) which I haven't
              run yet.&nbsp; PASS3 and PASS4 are entirely devoted to
              production of Simulation Data Files (SDF).&nbsp; SDFs were
              what were used as input to the digital simulation system
              that simulated running the Shuttle flight software.&nbsp;
              They're quite fancy.&nbsp; I'm told by the author of PASS3
              and PASS4, Craig Schulenberg, that never has any other
              compiler of any kind produced such complete data in
              support of simulation.<br>
            </p>
            <p>My own desired next step in the compiler development is
              to run the compiler passes related to SDF
              generation.&nbsp; Simultaneously the SDF documents appear
              in the Shuttle library.&nbsp; Nifty!&nbsp; Kismet!&nbsp;
              Whether that's truly what I do next is TBD, but that's my
              whim at the moment.<br>
            </p>
            <p>By the way, this is all being written up on <a
                moz-do-not-send="true" href="XPL.html">the XPL page of
                the website</a>, basically in real time as I'm working
              on it.&nbsp; Which means that it's a poorly-organized mess
              at the moment.&nbsp; Still, it's there if anybody wants to
              read it.&nbsp; I hope that it won't be too much longer
              before the compiler is debugged to the point where I can
              bless it as completely working, and proceed to put the
              documentation in order.&nbsp; Of course, wishes don't
              always come true.&nbsp; And anyone who's familiar with my
              writing style — just take a gander at this blog entry! —
              will realize that it still may not be very readable once
              I've reorganized it.&nbsp; But at least it will be more
              readable than it is now.&nbsp; I hope.<br>

          <td valign="top">Mike released the reconstruction of
            MANCHE72R3 today.&nbsp; That's the software for the Command
            Module AGC flown on Apollo 13.&nbsp; It inherits the same <i>Cosmic






















              Spoonerism</i> — like that term? — suffered by the
            Comanche 72 reconstruction I mentioned a couple of days
            ago:&nbsp; I.e., it has a couple of places where a couple of
            instructions can be swapped without damaging either the
            functionality or the memory-bank checksums, and without any
            guidance from other related software versions to tell us
            which order is more-likely to be the correct one.&nbsp;
            Ultimately, the Cosmic Spoonerism isn't something to worry
            about, but resolving it requires somehow getting additional
            info which we don't have now.&nbsp; At any rate, <a
              moz-do-not-send="true" href="Colossus.html#Apollo13">both
              versions are now written up on the Colossus page</a>, and
            properly incorporated in the document library, as well as
            being supported in the VirtualAGC GUI.<br>
            <br>
            Of less interest to anybody but me, I expect, I've just hit
            a nice little milestone with the XPL/I compiler — I call it
            XCOM-I — I've been working on.&nbsp; You may recall that I'm
            doing that so that I can eventually use XCOM-I to compile
            the Intermetrics compiler (HAL/S-FC) for the HAL/S computer
            language in which Space Shuttle flight software was written,
            and then use HAL/S-FC to compile the flight software
            itself.&nbsp; Not that I'm anywhere close to that!&nbsp; But
            the milestone is that I'm now able to "bootstrap" one of the
            old XPL compilers from back in the day.&nbsp; Not
            Intermetrics's XPL compiler, mind you, because the source
            code for that one has been lost.&nbsp; Rather, for an XPL
            compiler I call XCOM45, last built (as far as I know) in
            1976 at the State University of New York.&nbsp; By
            "bootstrapping", I refer to a process used by programmers
            who write a compiler for a particular computer language in
            that same language, and want to use that compiler to build
            its own source code.&nbsp; Obviously you can't do that on
            day one, since you can't build anything from literally
            nothing, so there's a series of intervening steps needed to
            build a more-and-more competent compiler that <i>eventually</i>
            can compile itself.&nbsp; That's "bootstrapping".&nbsp; In
            the case of my milestone, the bootstrapping steps look like
            this:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>Use XCOM-I (my XPL/I compiler) to compile the source
                code for XCOM45, giving me an executable version of
                XCOM45 that runs on my Linux computer.&nbsp; Call that
                version XCOM45-linux.</li>
              <li>Use XCOM45-linux to <i>again</i> compile the source
                code for XCOM45.&nbsp; Since the original XCOM45 ran on
                an IBM 360 computer, this gives us an IBM 360 version of
                XCOM45.&nbsp; Call that version XCOM45-360.</li>
              <li>Use XCOM45-360, running in an IBM 360 simulator, to
                compile the source code for XCOM45 <i>yet again</i>.&nbsp;






















                This gives us yet another IBM 360 version of
                XCOM45.&nbsp; Call that version XCOM45-360A.</li>
              <li>If all went well, XCOM45-360 and XCOM45-360A should be
                byte-for-byte identical ... and they are.&nbsp; <i>Voilà!</i>&nbsp;























                XCOM45 can compile itself, 100% accurately.&nbsp; But
                more importantly for us, XCOM-I must have been working
                pretty well to make that happen.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you have read that description closely — and who <i>wouldn't</i>
              have wanted to do <i>that</i>? — it barely mentions an
              important fact that I've neglected up to now in this blog,
              which is that our software repository now contains a very
              lightweight IBM 360 simulator called sim360.&nbsp; This
              was not written by me, or anyone at Virtual AGC, but was
              instead written by Dan Weaver and barely mentioned <a
                moz-do-not-send="true"
                href="https://sourceforge.net/u/shoefoot/profile/">on
                his own website</a>.&nbsp; (See if you can find sim360
              on the website.&nbsp; Give yourself a cookie as a reward
              if you can.)&nbsp; There are several reasons it's
              significant for <i>us</i>:&nbsp; A not inconsiderable
              advantage it has over full-scale IBM 360 simulators such
              as <a moz-do-not-send="true"
                href="http://www.hercules-390.org/">Hercules</a> is that
              you don't have to know anything about operating an IBM 360
              to use it.&nbsp; Nor does it require any
              potentially-copyrighted software from (say) IBM that would
              prevent integrating it with open-source software.&nbsp;
              But perhaps best of all, it's <i>so</i> lightweight that
              it probably technically can be incorporated into (say)
              Orbiter or the VirtualAGC GUI relatively easily, and can
              be adapted (if any adaptation is needed) to run IBM
              AP-101S code rather than IBM 360 code.&nbsp; Admittedly
              I'm looking down the road a bit, but it seems to me as
              though sim360 provides a superior technical path to
              running Space Shuttle flight software in a spaceflight
              simulator.&nbsp; As for the legality of that path (or <i>any</i>
              path) under ITAR, I make no claims.<br>

            taking note of it.&nbsp; Long-time readers may recall that I
            had spent a considerable amount of effort myself on trying
            to reconstruct Comanche 67 — indeed, <a

href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/comanche67/Comanche067">you






















              can still see my now-obsoleted effort in the comanche067
              branch of our software repository</a> — before giving up
            on it as beyond my capacity, and indeed perhaps beyond
            anyone else's capacity either.&nbsp; Still, I had made some
            not-insignificant progress before doing so, and it will turn
            out to be interesting (only to me, I suppose) to see how
            successful I had been with the changes I did make.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking of which, having Comanche 67 is useful not merely
            in that it's one of the (few) remaining AGC flight-software
            versions that had still been missing, but also in that it's
            potentially a useful missing link in reconstructing Comanche
            72 (Apollo 13), which is yet another of the missing
            versions.&nbsp; Mind you, <i>I'm</i> not promising that;
            I'm just saying it's an interesting possibility, given the
            tremendous success Mike has had in reconstructing missing
            versions (yay!), even if I have not (boo!).<br>
            <br>
            But that's leaping too far ahead.&nbsp; For today, note that
            all I've done so far is to post <a moz-do-not-send="true"

            binary in hand.<br>
            <br>
            There's still much to be done, though, such as writing up
            the details on the Colossus page, making Comanche 67
            available in our VirtualAGC GUI wrapper for the AGC
            emulation, and of course, reconstructing the source
            code!&nbsp; Ego would lead me to hope that the source code
            of my attempted reconstruction might help out there.&nbsp;
            But I doubt that that would fit in with Mike's workflow
            anyway, and likely he'll do a better job without it unless
            he uses a little of it to salve my tortured-poet ego.&nbsp;

            been through several abortive but non-negligible attempts to
            crack it.&nbsp; First I developed a HAL/S compiler that
            could be used also as an interactive HAL/S interpreter or
            emulator; it was quite useful, but never got to the point of
            supporting 100% of HAL/S's features before I stopped work on
            it for maintenance-difficulty reasons.&nbsp; Then I decided
            to port the original HAL/S compiler (HAL/S-FC), which was
            written in the mysterious, obsolete language XPL/I, to
            Python, so that it could be run on modern computer systems;
            I succeeded, but only for the 1st pass (of the compiler's 7
            passes), and stopped working on it because the effort for
            the first pass had been so great that I couldn't bear the
            thought of porting any more of the passes.<br>
            <br>
            Now I'm working on yet a third approach, and I'm feeling
            quite good about it because I passed a major milestone on it
            this morning.&nbsp; As I say, the original HAL/S compiler
            was written in the XPL/I language.&nbsp; Actually, everybody
            (including Intermetrics, which wrote the software) says that
            it was written in XPL, but it's not really true.&nbsp; There
            was indeed a computer language called XPL which was defined
            in a book called <i>A Compiler Generator</i> by McKeeman <i>et






















              al</i>.; the book also contained the complete listing for
            its XPL compiler (XCOM).&nbsp; But the truth is that
            Intermetrics had <i>extended</i> the language, so a
            standard XPL compiler couldn't compile it any longer, and in
            particular couldn't compile HAL/S-FC.&nbsp; Intermetrics
            instead had their own separate compiler for it.&nbsp;
            Intermetrics continued to call this extended language "XPL",
            but I insist on calling it "XPL/I" to make the distinction
            clear:&nbsp; An XPL/I compiler can compile HAL/S-FC, but a
            mere XPL compiler cannot, and there are no surviving XPL/I
            compilers that anybody I've talked to is aware of.<br>
            <br>
            What I've been working on lately <i>is</i> an XPL/I
            compiler, which I call XCOM-I.&nbsp; It can still compile
            standard XPL, but the goal is to compile full XPL/I.&nbsp;
            XCOM-I itself is written in Python and translates XPL/I to
            C, and hence is completely portable.&nbsp; The milestone
            XCOM-I reached this morning was to compile the original XPL
            compiler (XCOM) listed in <i>A Compiler Generator</i>, and
            then to use that original XCOM to compile some other XPL
            programs (listed in <i>A Compiler Generator</i> also) into
            correct IBM System/360 object-code.&nbsp; It was a hard-won
            milestone, and while it isn't as good as compiling HAL/S-FC
            itself would be, I'm still happy!<br>
            <br>
            In celebration, I've updated the Shuttle page accordingly,
            and in particular have made visible <a
              moz-do-not-send="true" href="XPL.html">a page about XCOM-I
              that I've been working on in the background for a while</a>.<br>
            <br>
            I would observe that HAL/S-FC can compile HAL/S to either
            IBM System/360 object code or else to IBM AP-101S (i.e.,
            Shuttle GPC) object code, both of which are based on IBM
            Basic Assembly Language (BAL).&nbsp; Therefore, it seems
            likely that the eventual technical path to emulating
            execution of the Shuttle flight software, and in particular
            to integrating it into spacecraft-simulator software, will
            be to emulate execution of IBM BAL.&nbsp; A BAL-to-C
            translator would be even better, I think.&nbsp; It would
            mean that Space Shuttle flight software could technically be
            integrated into spacecraft-simulation systems simply by
            incorporating its C code ... assuming, of course, that that
            weren't a regulatory issue <i>vis-à-vis</i> ITAR.&nbsp;
            Though the fact that the C code couldn't possibly execute on
            an AP-101S, and could be completely obfuscated versus the <i>relative</i>
            clarity of BAL code, would speak in its favor ITAR-wise (I
            assume).<br>

            number of documents from the backlog I finished processing
            yesterday made me a bit more careless than usual.&nbsp; For

            As for the backlog itself, that had come from the large

            and/or scanned them.&nbsp; An exception is that Don mentions

            if you look at the recently-added documents you'll find that
            some of them have been stamped or watermarked as belonging
            to that collection.&nbsp; James Tomayko, as you may recall,
            among many other things wrote the ubiquitous NASA history

            he cited (IR-60-7, "HAL/S-360 Compiler System

          <td valign="top">Since I've posted nothing substantive about
            Space Shuttle flight software in a while, I suppose I should
            give you an update on the progress towards presenting it to
            you in some useful fashion.&nbsp; There's good news and
            not-so-good news, though I think the good outweighs the
            not-so-good.&nbsp; There are three somewhat-independent
            aspects:<br>
            <ol>
              <li><i>Actual original flight-software source code and/or
                  object code.</i>&nbsp; I now have some of the source
                code and <i>all</i> of the GPC (IBM AP-101S) object
                code in hand, in some version which I don't care to
                specify at the moment.&nbsp; Does that sound a bit weak
                and wishy-washy, given my normal tendency to bombard you
                with every detail and every speculation that crosses my
                fevered brain?&nbsp; You're right, it is!&nbsp; The
                problem is that I've received this material on condition
                that I preserve it and can personally access it for
                compiler development, but that I <i>not</i> show it to
                anybody else.&nbsp; Or at least, not yet.&nbsp; Nor do I
                have any timetable on when I will be able to make to do
                so.&nbsp; Moreover, this confidentiality obligation is
                on top of whatever ITAR restrictions may limit
                distribution.&nbsp; Besides which, I can't even get any
                legal action started on the ITAR front until I'm given
                permission to show the source code to the
                attorneys.&nbsp; Why have I teasing you like this, given
                that I can't give you access to any of it?&nbsp; I still
                think it's good news.&nbsp; I have reason to believe
                that I will be able to make the material available at
                some point — at least if you're a "U.S. Person" for ITAR
                purposes — even if I don't know when that will be.&nbsp;
                And I think that I would want to know about it if I were
                the one reading this update rather than writing
                it.&nbsp; <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="smiley.png"
                  alt="" height="16" width="16"></li>
              <li><i>HAL/S compiler/emulator development for
                  compiling/running the flight software source code.</i>&nbsp;
























                Anyone who has been following my posts on the topic will
                recall that there have been two independent but
                somewhat-complementary lines of attack:&nbsp; first, a
                completely-homegrown HAL/S
                compiler/interpreter/emulator; and second, a port of the
                original HAL/S compiler from its now completely-obsolete
                XPL language into the modern Python language.&nbsp; Each
                of these approaches is partially working and partially
                unimplemented.&nbsp; But both are on hold at the moment,
                due mainly to the fact that their development is very
                exhausting; I've simply burnt myself out on it.&nbsp;
                Plus, the compilers aren't entirely useful without the
                missing portions of the flight-software source code I'm
                still awaiting.&nbsp; So I'm taking a break from HAL/S
                compiler development right now. <br>
              </li>
              <li><i>Distribution roadmap.</i>&nbsp; The question
                looming over all of this is how to distribute executable
                flight software in some manner that's useful for use in
                spacecraft simulators such as Orbiter, if there are ITAR
                restrictions?&nbsp; Personally, I would argue that if
                object code is distributed in a form that cannot be
                executed on the original Space Shuttle software, and
                cannot be reverse engineered in such a way as to make it
                so-executable, then it should be fine.&nbsp; For
                example, the original HAL/S compiler was able to compile
                flight software into object code either for an AP-101S
                target <i>or</i> for an IBM 360 target, and IBM 360
                object code would seem to me to be ITAR compliant.&nbsp;
                However, not everyone agrees with me.&nbsp; It has
                occurred to me, though, that ultimately it's not my
                responsibility nor that of the Virtual AGC Project to
                distribute code that's executable on a spacecraft
                simulator anyway.&nbsp; If/when I'm at liberty to
                distribute the flight-software source code to
                ITAR-qualified individuals who are involved in
                spacecraft simulation, <i>they</i> can use they can use
                their own judgement to produce object code they deem
                distributable without ITAR rish, or not.&nbsp; In other
                words, it's largely Somebody Else's Problem.</li>

            <p>On a different note, Mike has sent along a new stash of

                    <li>LM-3 Apollo Operations Handbook, Volume II. This
                      goes along with the Volume I that we've had a scan
                      of for a while now. Interestingly, it appears to
                      be written for an early-ish version of Sundance;
                      it describes usage of program P05 to exit standby
                      mode. The standby-exiting logic was made automatic
                      before Sundance actually flew.</li>
                    <li>Apollo Operations Handbook, Block II Spacecraft,
                      Volume I, from April 1970. This is a somewhat
                      later revision than our current (mostly
                      poor-quality) scans. This one should be much more
                      readable. Even though it's only from mid-1970, it
                      already has changes anticipated for the J-missions
                      incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Apollo SCS Training Manual, Block II from
                      Honeywell. This document goes into a lot of
                      deep&nbsp;detail on the operation of the Block II
                      Stabilization and Control System — more, I think,
                      than any other that we currently know about.</li>
                    <li>Apollo Portable Life Support Systems booklet
                      from Hamilton Standard. We already have scans of a
                      very similar booklet whose title includes "... and
                      Oxygen Purge Systems". Despite the shorter title,
                      this booklet is actually a later revision that
                      covers more of the system.</li>

          <td valign="top">Mike has sent over some dumps of SUNSPOT
            rope-memory modules, courtesy of <a moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="https://people.duke.edu/~ng46/">Dr. Nick Gessler</a>.&nbsp;






















            You'll recall that SUNSPOT (thought to be version 247) was
            the Command Module's AGC software for <b>Apollo 1</b>, and
            it has long been near the top of my wish list.&nbsp;
            Unfortunately, these modules were <i>not</i> from version
            247, but rather from the initial release of SUNSPOT ... and
            we're not sure specifically what that version was,
            numerically, due to the lack of surviving
            documentation.&nbsp; But it certainly significantly precedes
            247.&nbsp; Worse, only 5 of the 6 rope-memory modules were
            available, and those are in significantly worse condition
            than all of the other rope-memory modules Mike has worked
            with before.&nbsp; (Not Nick's fault, since the modules were
            that way when he got them.&nbsp; In case you're wondering
            how bad these are, visualize actual holes, through which
            wiring and components are visible!)&nbsp; So not all of the
            data on those 5 modules will be recoverable.&nbsp; But Mike
            will work his magic, and I fully expect we'll eventually get
            3 or more modules worth of data from them.&nbsp; It'll take
            quite a while, though, so don't put your life on hold
            waiting for it.&nbsp; At any rate, you can follow <a

            starting to look pretty good to me. <br>

          <td valign="top">There has been a problem for some time on <a
              moz-do-not-send="true" href="links-shuttle.html">the
              Shuttle Library page</a> in terms of the way it placed
            individual documents into the flight-specific
            sections.&nbsp; For example, it may have placed documents
            not directly relevant to flight STS-26 into the STS-26
            section on the library page.&nbsp; While I knew about this,
            I wasn't motivated to try and fix it until I started getting
            complaints about it.&nbsp; I noticed too that it wasn't
            printing the exact titles on the sections that I thought I
            had arranged for; for example, the title of the STS-26
            section <i>should</i> have been "Flight STS-51-F (STS-26)"
            rather than the mere "Flight STS-26" that was actually being
            printed.&nbsp; While the Shuttle Library page is still not
            perfect by any means, I think it has been improved a lot in
            these regards, and I hope my fixes will be enough of a
            bandaid for now ... though it's possible that the next few
            days might see some fixes for my fixes, and so on.&nbsp; You
            can thank Bill Miller for refocusing my attention on the
            issue.&nbsp; Bill also sent along the STS-79 Post-Mission
            Report, which has now been posted on the library page, and
            apparently completes our set of mission reports (<i>sans</i>
            the STS-51-L Challenger disaster, for which I'm told that a
            normal post-mission report wasn't produced).<br>
            <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Afterthought:</b>&nbsp; It's
                curious that I chose STS-26 as an example, since I see
                belatedly that it <i>still</i> mixes together documents
                from STS-26 proper vs STS-51-F due to miscategorization,
                as does STS-27.&nbsp; Well, there's always tomorrow for
                fixing that!</font><br>

            vanished.<br>
            <br>
            Oh, and I removed the link to the SourceForge project called
            Space Shuttle Ultra (SSU), as it seems to have disappeared
            as well.&nbsp; It was a Space Shuttle add-on for the Orbiter
            spaceflight simulation system.&nbsp; It seems to have been
            announced a little over a year ago on the Orbiter forum that
            the SSU project was dead, so I guess I must have just been
            behind the times in posting a link to it.&nbsp;
            Incidentally, there was a recommended alternative mentioned
            there, namely <a moz-do-not-send="true"

            though as far as I can tell SSV lacks the small reference
            library of Shuttle documents sported by SSU.&nbsp; Again, I
            wish I had downloaded its complete contents as well!&nbsp;

          <td valign="top">As I mentioned in my last post, which was a
            month ago but seems like a year, all of my personal effort
            recently has been devoted to getting the original compiler
            for Space Shuttle flight software into a form in which we
            can use it nowadays ourselves.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            You'll recall that the Shuttle's flight software (known as
            PASS and BFS) was written in a now-obsolete programming
            language called HAL/S — for which, as far as I know, there
            are no longer any surviving functioning compilers.&nbsp; Or
            at least, none running on common types of computer systems
            available to common folk such as ourselves.&nbsp; We <i>do</i>
            have the complete source code for that original compiler,
            which was called HAL/S-FC.&nbsp; But that source code is
            primarily written in an even-more obsolete programming
            language called XPL, which also has no available functioning
            compilers, combined at some crucial points with IBM 360
            assembly language (known as BAL).&nbsp; And even worse, it
            was a mostly-undocumented "enhanced" form of XPL, so even if
            you somehow managed to get a standard XPL compiler, it still
            wouldn't compile the source code for HAL/S-FC.<br>
            <br>
            My workaround for these little deficiencies has been to port
            the original HAL/S-FC's XPL source code to a modern
            programming language, namely Python 3, that anybody can run
            on any common computer system, such as Windows, Mac OS, or
            Linux.&nbsp; I won't claim that this has been an easy
            task.&nbsp; There have been, and continue to be, many
            hurdles along this path.&nbsp; If I had known just how many,
            I might have elected not to attempt it at all.<br>
            <br>
            But I'm pleased to say that a nice little milestone has been
            reached:&nbsp; The ported HAL/S-FC can now compile without
            error every syntactically-correct HAL/S source-code file
            available to me.<br>
            <br>
            You have to take that assessment with a grain of salt, since
            it merely means that there are no compile-time error
            messages.&nbsp; That's not a guarantee that whatever object
            code the compiler generates is correct.&nbsp; Nor should it
            be taken to imply that we can actually run any of that code
            after compilation.&nbsp; Nor that we actually have much
            HAL/S source code to try it on; almost all HAL/S source code
            we have has been scraped from contemporary documentation
            rather than from actual flight software.&nbsp; But first
            things first!&nbsp; It's a step forward, and much much nicer
            than the hundreds of compiler errors I was getting even very
            recently.<br>

            <br>

            the future as I continue trying to overcome the hurdles.<br>

              <li>Those of you who follow the LVDC action will know that
                the "Equation Defining Document" (EDD) is the principal
                documentation for the LVDC's flight program, but that up
                to now we've had only Parts I and II of Revision A of
                the Saturn IB portion of the EDD.&nbsp; We've now added
                Revisions C, D, and K, though unfortunately only the
                changed pages.&nbsp; Most significant, though, is that
                we now also have <i>complete</i><i> Parts III and IV</i>
                of Revision K.&nbsp; Revision K, by the way, is for the
                Apollo-Soyuz Test Program (ASTP) mission.&nbsp; Taken
                altogether, that's hopefully the complete Saturn IB EDD,
                more or less.&nbsp; Alas, we still have no Saturn V
                version of the EDD.</li>
              <li>We now have documentation of the LVDC Preflight
                Program, not to mention several revisions of the
                software-verification plan for it, though unfortunately
                no source code.&nbsp; Given that up to now we've had
                only <i>inferences</i> about the Preflight Program,
                without any documentation or indeed any admission from
                any of the original developers that they even knew
                anything whatsoever about it, that's a huge leap
                forward.&nbsp; This information is from the "Generalized
                Flight Program" (GFP) era, though, and there's reason to
                believe that the Preflight Program may have been
                simplified somewhat in that era, vs what it had been in
                the earlier period when each LVDC Flight Program was
                more customized.&nbsp; Thus this Preflight Program
                documentation is useful in relation to our LVDC Flight
                Program software listings for AS-512 and AS-513, but
                less so — and perhaps considerably so — for the
                AS-206RAM Flight Program.</li>
              <li>We have documentation for ASTEC and ACAPE programs ...
                which is significant, but which I admit requires some
                explanation.&nbsp; "ASTEC" stands for "Aerospace System
                Test and Evaluation Complex", and essentially comprises
                the ground test equipment related to the LVDC.&nbsp; The
                Programmable Test Controller (PTC) is one component of
                this collection of equipment.&nbsp; I can't claim to
                have fully digested this new document, unless skimming
                it briefly so that I can meaninglessly parrot to
                acronyms qualifies as digesting it.&nbsp; But if I
                understand correctly, the ASTEC or ACAPE program ran on
                the PTC, which was in turn attached to an LVDA and an
                LVDC running the Preflight Program.&nbsp; ASTEC or ACAPE
                were each used to test or debug the
                simultaneously-running Preflight Program.&nbsp; I don't
                know that my PTC simulator supports this configuration —
                actually, I sure it doesn't at the moment — but since we
                lack source code for ASTEC and ACAPE, that's not yet an
                urgent problem.&nbsp; The new document has only
                flowcharts for ASTEC and ACAPE.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Another quick note about the new EDD documents mentioned
              above:&nbsp; You may recall that about 3 months ago I was
              excited by the notion that LVDC Flight Program flowcharts
              could be regenerated by mysterious markings in the AS-512
              and AS-513 source code, and that I had worked myself up
              the point of writing software to generate these flowcharts
              and to <a moz-do-not-send="true"
                href="LVDC.html#Flowcharts">publish them</a>. (See the
              2023-07-27 entry below.)&nbsp; Well, part of the reason I
              was motivated to do that is because we <i>didn't</i> have
              Part III of the EDD, because Part III does indeed contain
              flowcharts.&nbsp; Now that we <i>do</i> have Part III, we
              have the exciting prospect of discovering how misguided or
              how prescient I was.&nbsp; Well, perhaps "exciting" isn't
              exactly the word I'm looking for.&nbsp; "Terrifying" is
              perhaps what I should be going for.&nbsp; <br>
            </p>
            <p>I should clarify that I have <i>not</i> made a flowchart
              comparison before writing this, and am looking at it right
              now, in real time, as I'm writing this ... and the verdict
              is that the flowcharts don't look extremely similar.&nbsp;
              On the other hand, there's some obvious resemblance.&nbsp;
              <i>Part</i> of the problem, I'm sure, is that in comparing
              my Saturn V flowcharts to these Saturn IB flowcharts,
              we're not seeing apples-to-apples; even the names of the
              subroutines may differ.&nbsp; In other words, maybe the
              flowcharts shouldn't match.&nbsp; Well, who knows? Here's
              a cherry-picked result from the ACCELEROMETER READ
              subroutine that makes my flowcharts look especially good;
              but don't imagine this is a typical example.&nbsp; An
              excerpt from <a moz-do-not-send="true"
                href="flowcharts/AS-512-flowcharts/ACCELEROMETER_READ_(AR).dot.ps.png">my

              heartening, I think, that where the text is comparable, it
              matches.<br>

            With the new LVDC documents out of the way, let me explain
            the delay in posting messages for the last couple of months.<br>
            <br>
            To dredge up ancient history, you may recall (see the
            2023-02-15 entry below) that I had been developing from
            scratch a compiler, interpreter, and emulator for the HAL/S
            computer language in which the Space Shuttle's primary
            flight software ("PFS" or "PASS") and backup flight software
            ("BFS") were written, and that I had been making good
            progress on it.&nbsp; However, when we were flooded with new
            LVDC software listings for the AS-512 (Apollo 17) and AS-513
            (Skylab 1) missions, there was so much work involved in
            transcribing these listings and in fixing up our LVDC
            assembler to assemble them, I had to put the new HAL/S
            compiler on hold for until a couple of months ago.&nbsp; In
            other words, I switched over completely from Space Shuttle
            work to Apollo LVDC work.<br>
            <br>
            In the meanwhile (see the 2023-04-16 entry below), we had
            received the complete source code for the <i>original</i>
            HAL/S compiler, of which before we had had only a
            part.&nbsp; So when my work on the LVDC wound down, I
            rethought the idea of completing my own HAL/S
            compiler.&nbsp; Or perhaps more accurately, decided to
            postpone it.&nbsp; It seemed to me after the passage of
            several months that perhaps my compiler had grown to be too
            cumbersome and difficult to maintain and extend.&nbsp;
            Perhaps, I thought, it might be better to port the <i>original</i>
            HAL/S compiler from the intractable language in which it was
            written, XPL, to a modern language like Python.&nbsp; And
            indeed, that's what I've been doing ever since.&nbsp; The
            progress is good, but it's slow-going and I'm not even close
            to running any of the code it compiles.&nbsp; That's why I
            haven't been posting about it incessantly.&nbsp; I'll let
            you know when there's more to know.<br>
            <br>
            Our LVDC page has also been updated with a lot of this
            information.&nbsp; As you can imagine, the "<a
              moz-do-not-send="true" href="LVDC.html#Flowcharts">Flight
              Program Flowcharts</a>" has been significantly
            modified.&nbsp; Besides which, since the new Preflight
            Program documentation contains software flowcharts as well —
            had I mentioned that? — a new "<a moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="LVDC.html#PreflightFlowcharts">Preflight Program
              Flowcharts</a>" section has been added as well.<br>
            <br>
            Incidentally, our Space Shuttle page has not been updated
            with anything about the port of the original HAL/S compiler
            as of yet, but perhaps it will be in the not-too-distant
            future.<br>

              section "Saturn Interaction With the AGC"</a>.&nbsp; It
            should be a lot clearer and more accurate now concerning the
            circumstances, specific missions, and extent to which the
            AGC could theoretically have been used to control the
            various stages of the Saturn launch vehicle.&nbsp; This was
            in response to a theoretical notion about implementing the
            communication between the AGC and the LVDC in yaAGC and
            yaLVDC.&nbsp; The short answer is:&nbsp; There never was any
            such communication.&nbsp; The long answer, in case you're
            wondering, is the same as the short answer.&nbsp; But the
            question itself still resulted in improved commentary, I
            hope, so it was still worthwhile asking it.<br>

          <td valign="top">Nik Beug had a nifty idea a while back, which
            we've finally been able to put into effect.&nbsp; He pointed
            out that according to the contemporary LVDC documentation,
            the LVDC Flight Program — which <i>he</i>, alas, has not
            been able to see personally, due to potential ITAR
            restrictions! — had a sort of flight-simulation mode built
            into it.&nbsp; In that flight-simulation mode, it was
            possible to detach the LVDC from the peripheral devices in
            the Saturn rocket but let it <i>pretend</i> it was still
            attached to them, by performing its own simulation of the
            physics.<br>
            <br>
            For example, when you put the Flight Program into this
            flight-simulation mode, the LVDC could basically perform a
            complete simulation, all by itself, of the Saturn rocket
            blasting off and going into orbit, without the hassle of
            simulating any of the other associated hardware, such as the
            LVDA or the analog Flight Computer.&nbsp; The original
            developers, I suppose, used this feature to test the Flight
            Program, but <i>we</i> can use it to test our LVDC CPU
            emulator.<br>
            <br>
            Besides which, it's a nice demonstration that LVDC usage,
            which is otherwise difficult to demonstrate.&nbsp; Remember
            that unlike (say) the AGC, the LVDC has no user interface
            ... it's just a black box, in all respects other than its
            actual color!&nbsp; So seeing it do anything at all has so
            far generally been an exercise in patience and stubbornness.<br>
            <br>
            But no longer!&nbsp; Nik's simulation idea has now been made
            to work, and I've written up <a moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="LVDC.html#DoingSomething">a preliminary discussion</a>
            for you of how to do it.&nbsp; The discussion is
            "preliminary", because it's very new at this point, and I
            don't necessarily have every detail correct just yet.&nbsp;
            (In fact, I got a message to that effect in the very process
            of typing the preceding sentence!)&nbsp; But it certainly
            does appear to work, and it's not all that difficult to do.<br>

            Lushbaugh over the last 6 months or so.&nbsp; That's an
            additional 450+ documents.&nbsp; The topics of these
            documents and those added yesterday are wide-ranging, though
            I suppose it's fair to say that many of them are operational
            in nature, and none relate directly to the internals of the
            Shuttle's various computer systems or their software.&nbsp;
            For example, there are lots of flight checklists and flight
            plans.&nbsp; Their value insofar as elucidating the flight
            software is concerned is probably mostly related to
            understanding usage and version changes.&nbsp; But if
            there's one thing I've learned throughout the course of the
            Virtual AGC Project, it's that documents you imagined had no
            relevance were disturbingly likely to provide essential
            information.<br>
            <br>
            Meanwhile, Shuttle veteran Bill Miller has pointed out that
            while our library's previous 2-volume Space Shuttle Missions
            Summary was incomplete, stopping as it did at STS-131, the
            complete document (through STS-135) was in fact available
            elsewhere.&nbsp; So the full document has now been added to
            the library.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Bill has also pointed out that while my distinction on <a
              moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle.html">the Shuttle
              page</a> between PASS (Primary Avionics System Software)
            and PFS (Primary Flight Software) may perhaps have been
            technically correct, it nevertheless ignored the common
            usage of those terms.&nbsp; Namely, that the term PASS is
            generally used in preference to PFS even when PFS may be
            technically the correct choice.&nbsp; Given that that has
            been my experience as well, I've adjusted the Shuttle page
            to accommodate the common usage and phased out most uses of
            PFS.<br>

          <td valign="top">Given that I've finished up the
            immediately-pending LVDC work I had been engaged in (i.e.,
            transcription, assembler fixes, flowcharts, and syntax
            highlighting), I've now exited from LVDC work for the time
            being.&nbsp; Instead, I'm now trying to knock down addition
            to the library of the vast backlog of Shuttle documents I've
            been given, but which have been languishing in my to-do
            list.&nbsp; 150+ documents have thus been added to <a

            iceberg.&nbsp; After that particular iceberg has melted,
            hopefully I can go back to working on the Shuttle HAL/S
            compiler; but just now that still seems comfortably far off.<br>
            <br>
            That's not to say that there's <i>no</i> LVDC work still in
            progress.&nbsp; Via hardware simulation, Mike has discovered
            a number of bugs in my implementation of the LVDC CPU
            emulator and has been patiently fixing them, so you'll see
            updates to that in the software repository, if you follow
            such things.&nbsp; And more may come.&nbsp; The bugs have
            been primarily in the area of CPU startup, and the <tt>MPY</tt>,
            <tt>MPH</tt>, <tt>DIV</tt>, and <tt>EXM</tt>
            instructions.&nbsp; Good thing Mike has my back on that
            one!&nbsp; As you may recall, he fixed a number of bugs in
            the AGC emulator via the same technique.&nbsp; But the
            difference in the AGC case was that we actually had a
            not-terrible (though not entirely complete either) set of
            AGC electrical schematics back then.&nbsp; And <i>now</i>
            have essentially a complete set of AGC schematics for many
            different revisions of the hardware.&nbsp; Whereas we have
            no such thing for the LVDC.&nbsp; So in the absence of
            electrical schematics, how has Mike managed a usable
            hardware simulation capable of cross-checking the behavior
            of the software emulation?&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Well, our primary documentation about the LVDC is the "<i>Laboratory

            a theory-operation-document if you read it in the right
            spirit.&nbsp; And as such, if you're diligent enough, from
            the description and the bits of circuitry pictured within,
            you can apparently cobble together enough of the LVDC
            circuitry to emulate its behavior.&nbsp; Personally, I never
            would even have guessed it was possible to do that ...
            though given that for the <i>AGC</i> we have various
            supplemental theory-of-operation documents like ND-1021041
            and ND-1021042 that would let us do that for the AGC if we
            didn't already have actual schematics, I don't suppose I
            should be too surprised.&nbsp; Nevertheless I am.&nbsp; Good

          <td valign="top">Concerning LVDC flowcharts ....&nbsp; I've
            mentioned these obliquely in the last couple of weeks,
            without giving any substantive detail before now.&nbsp;
            Here's the story:&nbsp; The AS-512 (Apollo 17) and AS-512
            (Skylab 1) LVDC software listings — which for the upteenth
            time, <i>may</i> or <i>may not</i> be restricted by ITAR
            from being presented publicly here — have certain mysterious
            markings in column 71 of the punch-cards.&nbsp; Column 71
            happens to be the last column of the program-comments field
            of LVDC source-code lines.&nbsp; These markings are
            undocumented, unsurprisingly, since we have essentially no
            documentation about LVDC assembly language, and so the
            markings' purpose and usage rules were not apparent to
            us.&nbsp; After thinking about these markings for a couple
            of months, I formed the notion that they could be used to
            produce mid-level flowcharts of the LVDC source code.&nbsp;
            To test this notion, I subsequently wrote
            flowchart-generator software to convert the AS-512 and
            AS-513 LVDC source code into flowcharts.&nbsp; Whether or
            not the resulting flowcharts provide any meaningful
            representation of the software, or indeed whether they are
            useful in any sense at all, remains to be seen.<br>
            <br>
            In calling these flowchart "mid-level", I mean that they
            expose the flow of control within the corresponding
            software, but they do not provide any calculational details
            that would let you go in the reverse direction to re-create
            the software from just the flowcharts.&nbsp; If you want an
            analogy, instead of software source code, imagine the
            engineering design of an automobile, say a BMW X3.&nbsp;
            These flowcharts, in automobile terms, tell you that the BMW
            X3 has an "engine" and a "battery" and a "carburetor", and
            so on, fitting together in certain ways.&nbsp; All of which
            may or may not be true; but working backwards from that
            isn't enough to even create a working automobile, let alone
            a BMW X3 specifically, because it still doesn't tell you how
            you <i>make</i> an "engine" or any of the other component
            parts.<br>
            <br>
            At any rate, partially on that basis, I conclude that
            whatever the ITAR status of the LVDC software source code,
            there's no reason whatever to suppose that these
            newly-generated flowcharts are subject to any export
            controls.&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="LVDC.html#Flowcharts">The LVDC page's new AS-512 and
              AS-513 Flowcharts section</a> has thus been updated with
            all this info and with all of the new AS-512 and AS-513
            flowcharts.&nbsp; You can decide for yourself whether
            they're of any value or not, though of course if you want to
            decide on their accuracy you'll have to follow the
            instructions to get access to the LVDC flight program source
            code, and to perform the manual effort of comparing the
            flowcharts to the code.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            I'm sure there are lots and lots of errors in the
            flowcharts, but I don't personally have the time and
            inclination to pursue them at this time any more than I have
            already.&nbsp; At least not <i>sans</i> feedback by you, my

            conversation with one of the original LVDC developers who
            was lamenting the inadequate documentation they were
            presented with in trying to create new LVDC flight program
            versions by adapting the preceding versions.&nbsp; He tells
            me that they often had to resort to running the legacy code
            on the PTC, single-stepping and setting breakpoints and
            what-not, just to figure out what the code was even
            doing.&nbsp; Which I'm perfectly sympathetic to, given how
            difficult it sometimes is to figure out legacy code ... and
            pretty frightened by as well, if you think about the
            astronauts needing to ride a rocket programmed under those
            circumstances.&nbsp; That's life on the bleeding edge for
            you!<br>

              LVDC assembler is now fully working</a>.&nbsp; At least,
            until the next LVDC program is found and exhibits funky new
            features not supported by the assembler as-is when we try to
            assemble it.&nbsp; Hopefully the probability of that
            happening is reduced, even if it can never be exactly
            zero.&nbsp; And I should clarify that my present goal is
            just production of the correct object code when valid LVDC
            source code is input.&nbsp; There are plenty of <i>other</i>
            respects in which the LVDC assembler isn't great, such as
            not being very robust when confronted with certain types of
            LVDC programming errors.&nbsp; Given my disturbingly-finite
            capabilities, however, those <i>other</i> respects are also
            problems for some <i>other</i> day.<br>
            <br>
            The provisos I mentioned above are either serious or
            negligible, depending on your point of view, and are two in
            number:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>A few <tt>WORK</tt> directives need to be added to
                the LVDC source code to provide information to the
                assembler that I wish the assembler could deduce for
                itself.&nbsp; <tt>WORK</tt> directives are my own
                invention, and don't exist in the original LVDC assembly
                language.&nbsp; PTC ADAPT SELF-TEST and AS-206RAM need
                no such added directives, fortunately, but I was forced
                to add two of them to AS-512 and three of them to
                AS-513.&nbsp; Most of them I actually know how to get
                rid of, I think, but <i>so far</i> the cost of the
                programming effort to do so just isn't worth it to me.</li>
              <li>There is a mismatch between the way the original
                assembler and the modern assembler round decimal
                numbers, so that for a very small percentage of decimal
                constants, the original and modern assemblers disagree
                in the least significant bit in the octal object
                code.&nbsp; I'm inclined to regard these discrepancies
                as due to bugs in the original assembler's arithmetic,
                but trying to offload blame from myself back onto 1960's
                and 1970's IBM FSD is pointless: The modern assembler is
                supposed to mimic the original, and as long as it can't
                mimic this rounding bug (if it <i>is</i> indeed a bug),
                the modern assembler cannot be fully complete.&nbsp;
                There are 19 of these rounding errors in AS-512 and 11
                in AS-513, out of 1000+ decimals, but there are none in
                AS-206RAM or PTC ADAPT SELF-TEST.&nbsp; At the moment,
                the modern assembler simply has a command-line switch (<tt>--fuzzy</tt>)
                that avoids reporting these as errors, thus letting you
                ignore them.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            Whether, how, or when these issues will be fixed remains
            nebulous.<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#666666">What all of the negative blather above
              fails to celebrate is the positive news that the
              transcriptions of the AS-512 and AS-513 flight programs to
              source code and to octal listings can now be regarded as
              complete and debugged.&nbsp; Obviously!&nbsp; Or else
              there would be mismatches between the assembled code and
              the transcribed object code, and I just told you there
              aren't any.&nbsp; Of course, the surety of correctness
              extends only to the data and code transformed to
              executable object code, and not to the program comments in
              those source-code files.&nbsp; I'm sure that there are
              many errors in program comments still awaiting discovery!</font><br>

            process of releasing reconstructed source code for various
            AGC programs that we've previously released only as octal
            dumps of their physical core-rope memory modules.&nbsp; All
            of these program share characteristics of correct assembly,
            of not being quite as perfect as we'd like, and of
            nevertheless being good enough that we think they're useful
            as-is.&nbsp; We'd hate for them to be lost through our own
            negligence in not making them available.&nbsp; Not to
            mention the fact that the more eyeballs are on them, the
            greater the probability that they can be improved over
            time.&nbsp; The <i>lacunae</i>, as usual, are sections that
            don't correspond closely enough to any other available
            assembly listing that we can guess symbolic labels, program
            comments, or certain other technical aspects of the

          <td valign="top">Big doings a-transpiring today!&nbsp; Well,
            that's a bit of a misstatement.&nbsp; I guess it would be
            more accurate to day that like everybody involved in
            engineering design, we're often fighting a battle between
            what's too imperfect to release versus what's too
            significant not to release.&nbsp; Or as it's sometimes said,
            not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.&nbsp; So
            I'm announcing several items today that fall somewhat under
            that rather vague umbrella of worthiness if not necessarily
            perfection.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>As you may recall, a few months back Mike Stewart was
                able to get dumps of core-rope memory modules for the
                Block I AGC programs Sunrise 45 and Sunrise 69, which
                were system-test programs used (among other things) for
                acceptance tests of Block I guidance-system
                equipment.&nbsp; Mike was able to fairly-quickly provide
                us with a reconstruction of Sunrise 45 source-code,
                although Sunrise 69 proved somewhat more challenging to
                a then-depleted Mike (I guess even he must have his
                limits) and thus has been languishing for quite a
                while.&nbsp; But the time is now ripe, even if the
                Sunrise 69 source code itself may still be a bit green,
                and so it's finally being made available today.&nbsp;
                There may be a few more <i>ad hoc</i> program labels in
                it that mightn't exactly match the original code than
                usual, but rest assured that the source code assembles
                correctly and is considerably better than nothing if you
                want to study the code!&nbsp; The "new" source code is
                now in our software repository, and you can see our
                usual colorized, syntax-highlighted version of it by
                looking at <a moz-do-not-send="true"
                  href="Colossus.html#Sunrise69">the improved Sunrise 69
                  write-up on the Colossus page</a>.</li>
              <li>Similar comments can be made about the source code for
                Corona 261, which was the Block I flight software for
                the unmanned AS-202 mission, the very first Apollo
                mission flown with a working AGC.&nbsp; Core-rope memory
                modules were dumped a while back, but a source-code
                reconstruction wasn't instantly at hand.&nbsp; On the
                other hand, why <i>should</i> we have expected an
                instant reconstruction?&nbsp; As it happens, part of the
                reason for the short delay is that the dump of the
                physical memory modules was a more-difficult affair than
                usual, and the uncertainty that the dump was exact was
                greater than usual, even though we thought it was
                very-likely correct.&nbsp; So Mike felt he had to make
                renewed efforts to see if the dump needed
                correction.&nbsp; Those efforts are now concluded, and
                we do indeed believe that the original dump was
                fine.&nbsp; Reconstructed Corona source code is thus now
                available, and you can either download it from the
                software repository, or view the colorized version of it

                  LVDC flight software for mission AS-512 (Apollo 17)
                  was completed about a month ago, but in such cases
                  there's always the suspicion that there may be typos
                  in it ... bugs.&nbsp; As it turns out, there
                  were.&nbsp; Lots of them!&nbsp; There are a number of
                  techniques for correcting such bugs, such as lots and
                  lots of proof-reading.&nbsp; Well, we didn't do
                  that!&nbsp; I'm sorry to say that for whatever reason
                  — possibly the potential ITAR restrictions on "export"
                  of this software — the pool of potential volunteers
                  for such LVDC-related activities is far smaller than
                  what I've experienced in the past for similar
                  AGC-related activities.&nbsp; In other words, the rate
                  of progress is far slower because the workload rests
                  on fewer shoulders.&nbsp; That's my excuse.&nbsp; As
                  it happens, though, the best technique we have for
                  debugging such source-code transcriptions is <i>not</i>
                  proof-reading, but rather assembly of the source code
                  and (automated) checking that the octal listing
                  produced by the assembler is identical to the octal
                  listing transcribed from the original printout.&nbsp;
                  That process is now complete, and so I regard the
                  AS-512 transcription as debugged.&nbsp; Any of you who
                  have been given a link to the LVDC assembly listings
                  by demonstrating you're legally qualified to view them
                  can access that transcribed source code in the git
                  repository at that link.&nbsp; A handful of
                  corrections were also made to the transcribed octal
                  listing, so if attempts to run AS-512 code in the LVDC
                  CPU emulator failed in the past, perhaps they might
                  succeed now.&nbsp; Of course, this particular
                  debugging technique cannot detect errors in program <i>comments</i>,
                  so those must either be tolerated or eventually
                  corrected by other means.</font></li>

                    assembler performs a number of activities behind the
                    scenes that are not explicitly tied to the source
                    code.&nbsp; The upshot of that is that there's a lot
                    of object code and allocated memory after an LVDC
                    assembly that was generated entirely by the
                    assembler itself.&nbsp; Since the aim of the the
                    modern LVDC assembler system is to produce object
                    code that agrees 100% with the original LVDC
                    assembler, it's necessary not only to figure out
                    what all of that extra stuff is, but to generate the
                    extra stuff in exactly the same way.&nbsp; And since
                    there is <i>no documentation available to us</i>
                    about LVDC assembly language or the original LVDC
                    assembler, figuring all that out is not only tricky
                    ... it may even be a fool's errand.&nbsp; Today,
                    though, I'm tentatively saying that the modern
                    assembler has been updated and is working, subject
                    to provisions discussed below.&nbsp; At the very
                    least, it can be used with AS-512 source code,
                    AS-206RAM source code, and PTC ADAPT Self-Test
                    Program source code.&nbsp; Unlike LVDC flight
                    software, the modern LVDC assembler is not regarded
                    as potentially in thrall to ITAR, so <a

            <p>As I mentioned, there are certain provisos in saying that
              the modern LVDC assembler now "works".&nbsp; In fact,
              there are three quirks that you have to live with if you
              want to assemble AS-512 source code.&nbsp; They aren't <i>terribly</i>
              bad, but they're annoying and I hope to eliminate
              them.&nbsp; At some point.&nbsp; Two of the quirks are
              addressed inserting a <tt>WORK ROOF</tt> or <tt>WORK
                BLOCK</tt> directive, altogether one of each, into the
              source code; while those are too technical to discuss
              here, <a moz-do-not-send="true"
                href="LVDC.html#Workarounds">you can read about them on
                the LVDC page</a> if you like.&nbsp; The third quirk is
              that in AS-512 there's a handful of locations — well, 19
              of them, so that's nearly two handfuls and two footfuls —
              at which the original assembler rounded floating-point or
              fixed-point decimal numbers in a way that I cannot
              understand, with the result that (from my perspective)
              they are wrong in the least-significant bit.&nbsp;
              Understand that I'm referring to literally thousands of
              locations in AS-206RAM and AS-512 at which such rounding
              is occurring, so this rounding error rarely happened ...
              but it happened <i>sometimes</i>.&nbsp; Personally, I
              think this was a (probably-undetected) bug in the original
              assembler, perhaps related to insufficient arithmetical
              precision in the computer running the assembler
              program.&nbsp; But that's not really a mitigating
              factor:&nbsp; The modern assembler needs to reproduce the
              bugs of the original, no questions asked, rather than
              stubbornly attempting to be "correct".&nbsp; Thus in the
              end, saying that the modern assembler "works" depends on
              how much you're willing to discount these 2 workarounds
              and 19 rounding discrepancies!<br>

                That's my own invention, hopefully temporary, for
                instructing the assembler to take various actions for
                which I haven't yet worked out an appropriate theory of
                operation or algorithmic basis for letting the assembler
                decide for itself.&nbsp; Here's an example:&nbsp; The
                original LVDC assembler, it appears to me, did not
                always correctly round fractional decimal values in
                converting them to binary, so those values may not agree
                with ones assembled by the modern assembler; until I
                work out why, I can temporarily add <tt>WORK</tt>
                directives to the AS-512 or AS-513 source code to
                enforce the appropriate (or inappropriate from my point
                of view) rounding by the modern assembler.&nbsp; After I
                eventually do figure it out, I can recode the modern
                assembler to act the same way as the original assembler,
                and remove the <tt>WORK</tt> directives.<br>

            <font color="#999999">Time sure flies!&nbsp; I've been
              buried so deeply in reworking the LVDC assembler to handle
              the Apollo 17 (AS-512) and Skylab 1 (AS-513) LVDC source
              code, that I haven't noticed how long it's taking.&nbsp;
              And it takes a lot, because not only were a number of new
              syntactic features added to the LVDC assembly language
              between AS-206RAM (for which I had designed the modern
              assembler) and AS-512/513, but also the assembler does
              various things differently under the surface.&nbsp; And of
              course, my requirements for our assembler demand that it
              produce not merely assembled code that works, but <i>precisely</i><i>
                the same</i> assembled code as the original
              assembler.&nbsp; Meaning that I have to figure out these
              invisible differences in how the original assembler
              worked, using as clues only the assembly listings it
              produced.&nbsp; Since there's no documentation available
              for the original assembler, that leaves me having to go
              about it scientifically:&nbsp; observe a difference,
              hypothesize what the assembler thought it was doing at the
              time, implement a similar change ... and then try, try
              again if it doesn't work identically.&nbsp; Tricky!&nbsp;
              It's going well, but there are lots of mysteries left
              before I'm done and can go back the working on the Space
              Shuttle's HAL/S compiler system.<br>
              <br>
              To give you an example of the kinds of difficulties I
              mean, consider the <tt>DEC</tt> pseudo-op, which in LVDC
              assembly language (and many other assembly languages like
              AGC) lets you give the assembler a decimal number that it
              converts to a binary representation and stores at the
              current location in memory.&nbsp; For example, in LVDC (or
              AGC) assembly language,<br>
            </font>
            <blockquote><font color="#999999"><tt>MY2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  DEC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.0B27</tt><br>
              </font></blockquote>
            <font color="#999999">means to store the machine's binary
              representation of the number 2.0 at the current memory
              location, which it also labels with the symbol <tt>MY2</tt>.&nbsp;























































              (Don't worry about the <tt>B27</tt> if you don't know
              what it means but it relates to the fact that the LVDC
              uses a 26-bit representation for numbers.)&nbsp; In
              AS-206RAM and AS-512, there are about 250 and 500 of these
              <tt>DEC</tt> statements altogether.&nbsp; In <i>four</i>
              of those in AS-512, the original assembler produced what I
              and my assembler think was the wrong least significant
              bit.&nbsp; In other words, there is a rounding
              error.&nbsp; 746 successes and 4 failures would sound
              pretty good in most situation ... except that in this
              situation it adds up to 100% failure!&nbsp; And why is the
              rounding wrong anyway?&nbsp; Is it me?&nbsp; Was the
              original assembler buggy?&nbsp; Dial me up next Tuesday,
              and perhaps I'll be able to tell you.&nbsp; But this
              little rounding bugaboo is not the last of my problems
              with the LVDC assembler.<br>

            that I'm dubious about posting, and which for that reason

            layers to the recent documents that were lacking them.&nbsp;
            Unfortunately, the large backlog of Shuttle documents is yet
            another matter.&nbsp; Processing of those documents remains
            on hold, as all of my Shuttle-related activity does, pending
            resolution of my current LVDC-related workload.&nbsp; Which
            is not imminent by any means.<br>

            (thanks!) has sent over yet another tranche of Apollo
            documents for the library, and this time I really (truly!)
            am going to take my time processing them.&nbsp; However, <a
              moz-do-not-send="true" href="links2.html#RecentAdditions">a
              few caught my eye and so I've gone ahead and added them to
              the library immediately</a>.&nbsp; The ones that caught my
            eye are a pair of documents related to the mission control
            center (MCC) in Houston.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            The first is a general MCC familiarization guide from 1967,
            <i>part</i> of whose information we already had in abridged
            form.&nbsp; It contains (among other things) a facility map,
            building-by-building floor-plans, descriptions plus pictures
            of the equipment therein for identification purposes,
            high-level block diagrams interrelating these things, schema
            of the data flow between them, and documentation trees of
            all the associated manuals for such equipment.&nbsp; There
            are <i>lots</i> of documents listed in the documentation
            tree, and we have few (or perhaps none) of them.<br>
            <br>
            More interesting from my standpoint is the MCC Operational
            Configuration for Apollo 15.&nbsp; For want of a better
            explanation, it's primarily an explanation of what data is
            available at each of the 100+ consoles, in detailed enough
            form that you could make a reasonable simulation of the
            consoles as long as you didn't insist on correct coloring
            and overall scale.&nbsp; Because who doesn't love a good
            simulation?&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="Console37-LOC3.jpg" alt=""
              height="93" align="right" width="250">To give you an
            example, Console no. 37 is "AGC/CMC Support", the image of
            which I've reproduced in a tiny form at the upper right, but
            which <a moz-do-not-send="true"

              can obviously see full size in the document itself</a>.&nbsp;



































































            I've highlighted one small area in green, which the document
            refers to as "LOC 3", and zoomed in on that area in the
            image at the lower right (unfortunately featuring my mouse
            cursor as well).&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true"

              on in the document</a>, the interpretations of each of the
            36 indicators in LOC 3 (as well as every indicator in all of
            the other LOCs of the console I <i>haven't</i> zoomed in
            on, and for every other console as well) are listed, of
            which here are a few:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>01 Upper, color=amber: <tt>CH OVRIDE</tt></li>
              <li>01 Lower, color=green: <tt>SCS CONT</tt></li>
              <li>02 Upper, color=red: <tt>CMC WARN</tt></li>
              <li>...</li>
              <li>18 Lower, color=red: <tt>P01 ENBL</tt></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pretty nifty, no?&nbsp; The only drawback is that the
              document <i>doesn't</i> tell us what slogans like "CH
              OVRIDE" may mean, nor what's displayed on the two CRT
              monitors (LOC 6 and LOC 7), so we need to look elsewhere
              ... oh well, too bad, so sad!&nbsp; Some of that stuff is
              pretty obvious, though, and perhaps some of the remainder
              is in the many, many missing manuals of the documentation
              tree that I mentioned above.<br>

                trajectory, and shall conduct diagnostic tests of itself
                and checkout routines of<br>
                other LEM subsystems".&nbsp; (Thanks to Cooper
                Lushbaugh.)<br>
              </li>
              <li>Ten or so "Apollo Mission Techniques" documents.&nbsp;
                (Thanks to Cooper Lushbaugh.)<br>
              </li>
              <li>A complete sample program in the MAC computer language
                (see below).&nbsp; (Thanks to Mike Stewart.)<br>
              </li>
              <li>A bunch of Tindallgrams (see below).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>MAC (MIT Algebraic Compiler) was a computer language
              somewhat like FORTRAN (though fancier in some ways) that
              theoretically would have been useful for scientific
              computing.&nbsp; Apparently, MIL/IL tested out potential
              AGC algorithms by coding them and running them in MAC
              before coding them for the AGC.&nbsp; I've often heard
              about it in the past, but basically haven't thought about
              it too much.&nbsp; Lately, though, we've gotten a fair
              amount of very early code written in MAC (not yet posted
              here!), so in preparation for dealing with that MAC code
              I've been looking into it a little bit.&nbsp; When my
              understanding is more complete, I'll probably write it up
              for the site in my typical wordy, overblown style, but I
              haven't done so yet; that's probably why this post is so
              long!&nbsp; (The "sample MAC program" I'm posting today,
              by the way, isn't the incoming MAC code I mean, as it's
              not even from Apollo.)<br>
            </p>
            <p>At any rate, I was shocked to realize that for all I've
              heard about it, up to this point we (the Virtual AGC
              Project) haven't had any code in MAC or <i>any</i>
              documentation about MAC other than superficial references
              to it.&nbsp; Moreover, I've found no available information
              online about MAC that's deeper than the "this computer
              language used to exist" variety.&nbsp; Of course, googling
              for "mac", as you may imagine, does not produce incredibly
              helpful results; thanks a lot, Apple!&nbsp; Fortunately,
              the language itself appears (at least superficially) to be
              quite easy to understand even without documentation,
              particularly now that I've been steeped in the HAL/S
              language used for the Space Shuttle flight software ...
              but I'd still prefer to have the documentation.&nbsp; And
              it's not as if the MAC language is secret or proprietary.
              It's simply that nobody ever seemed to bother.&nbsp; Which
              is a shame, considering that (as I say) we have incoming
              code actually written in it!<br>
            </p>
            <p>With that said, we have found <i>some</i> MAC
              documentation.&nbsp; But the news about it isn't
              rosy:&nbsp; Everything I've found so far is trapped in the
              MIT Library, and as near as I can tell, the MIT Library
              doesn't let anyone look at MIT Library materials except
              MIT staff, students, and faculty.&nbsp; And sometimes, if
              you're really lucky, researchers from affiliated
              institutions.&nbsp; What happens in the MIT Library <i>stays</i>
              in the MIT Library.&nbsp; As one of the non-elite myself,
              I therefore have no means of accessing any of these
              materials.&nbsp; Nor do I have any such elite folks on a
              string to go and fetch such material for me.&nbsp; The
              Library does have a searchable database, though, so they
              can have a giggle while dangling a list of the materials I
              can't access over my outstretched arms.&nbsp; For example,
              here are some of the juicy items you find:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>"The MAC Algebraic Language System", by Hal Laning and
                James Miller (1970), 23 pages, MIT/IL report R-681.<br>
              </li>
              <li>"The MAC Primer", by Henry B. Brainerd (1966), 39
                pages, MIT/IL doc E-2044.&nbsp; It relates to using MAC
                on the Honeywell computer that MIT/IL used before
                switching over to IBM computers.</li>
              <li>"The MAC-360 Primer", also by Brainerd (1969), 63
                pages, MIT/IL doc E-2393.&nbsp; It's the IBM-based
                document that superseded E-2044.</li>
              <li>... and others</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But enough of that!&nbsp; Regarding Tindallgrams, while
              I've mentioned them briefly somewhere on the site, I don't
              think I've posted any of them, or at least not many.&nbsp;
              At any rate, a lot of folks consider them very useful
              sources of information.&nbsp; ALSJ has posted a lot of
              them that apparently came from the UHCL archives, so there
              isn't too much need for reposting them here.&nbsp; But I'm
              nothing if not compulsive (or is it obsessive?), and some
              of the UHCL/ALSJ files are lacking a searchable text
              layer, so now that this gap in the Tindallgram race has
              been pointed out to me, I naturally need to OCR where
              necessary and repost!&nbsp; Apparently, Bill Tindall wrote
              around 1100 of these memos for Gemini and Apollo, and what
              I'm posting today is a half-dozen PDFs of a portion of
              them.&nbsp; Not that anything is being intentionally
              excluded, you understand, but merely that only a portion
              of the memos seem to have survived.&nbsp; There's now a
              dedicated "Tindallgrams" section in the document library.<br>
            </p>
            <p><font color="#999999">Finally, the initial transcription
                of the AS-512 LVDC flight program has been
                completed.&nbsp; Thank you to all participants!&nbsp;
                However, neither has it been proof-read for typos nor
                has it been debugged via assembly (and comparison of the
                assembly to the separately-transcribed octal
                listing).&nbsp; I expect — or perhaps more accurately, <i>dread</i></font><font
                color="#999999"> — that the assembler will itself
                require updates as the debugging process proceeds.&nbsp;
                At any rate, that's next on my agenda, beginning
                tomorrow and continuing until who knows when?&nbsp; My
                expectation is that the AS-513 LVDC flight program can
                be cut-and-pasted from the AS-512 LVDC flight program to
                a great extent, so I don't anticipate any work to begin
                on the AS-513 flight-program transcription until the
                AS-512 source code has been rendered as error-free as
                possible.<br>
              </font></p>
            <p><font color="#999999">I do expect to make some
                improvements to the LVDC assembler along the way:&nbsp;
                principally, giving it an option for producing
                color-coded, syntax-highlighted, hyperlinked, HTML
                assembly listings, much as the AGC and AGS assemblers
                have already been doing for many, many years now.&nbsp;
                I skipped this feature the first time around, when the
                LVDC assembler was only used for the AS-206RAM flight
                program, because fear of ITAR prevented me from
                "exporting" the nifty HTML assembly listings online and
                thus it didn't seem to be worth the effort.&nbsp; But <i>someday</i>
                I hope I can post the the LVDC software online, and even
                in the near term while I'm afraid to do so, souped-up
                assembly listings turn out to be such a very helpful
                study tool that I prefer not to do without them.&nbsp;
                I've become addicted to the syntax highlighting ever
                since I saw the LVDC color-coding scheme Mike created
                for the <b>vim</b> text editor, even though I've not
                been using <b>vim</b> myself for my contributions to
                the transcribed source code.<br>

                  System Mechanization. It is extremely good and I'm
                  very excited about it. The last ~140 pages are focused
                  on the AGC. Compared to ND-1021042 and ND-1021043, it
                  has less schematics but it does a significantly better
                  job of explaining how and why — so it is a great

            knowledge is obsolete.&nbsp; Though the fact that Apollo is
            not a moving target any longer is pretty useful for a
            project like Virtual AGC.&nbsp; There's no new thing under
            the sun in so far as Apollo is concerned, and being lazy,
            that's the way I like it!<br>

                few years back with the notion that the AGC software for
                the AS-202 mission might become available.&nbsp; You may
                also recall that AS-202 was the first flown mission with
                an AGC — albeit Block I — and hence this software
                (Corona 261 by name) was the first ever <i>flown</i>
                AGC software.&nbsp; Well, it has taken a while (seven
                years!), but we finally have it in hand.&nbsp; Not the
                source code, mind you, but a dump of the executable from
                the physical memory modules.&nbsp; Thanks to collector
                Jimmie Loocke, the owner of the modules, and to Mike
                Stewart, as usual, for dumping them.&nbsp; It's great to
                finally get that particular monkey off of our
                back!&nbsp; Of course, given the nature of this sad, old
                world, in which things seldom work out perfectly, there
                were more than the usual number of difficulties in
                performing this dump, so we're not <i>yet</i> entirely
                sure it's 100% accurate even though its memory-bank
                checksums are perfect.&nbsp; On the other hand, there's
                every expectation both that the source code will be
                recoverable, and that the process of doing so will
                uncover errors in the dump.&nbsp; So life's not all
                bad.&nbsp; In the meantime, you can run Corona 261 as it
                is right now in either the VirtualAGC GUI or in
                Orbiter+NASSP, though I'm not in a position to explain
                the latter any farther than that.&nbsp; At any rate, <a

            comprises passes 2, 3, and 4 of the compiler, whereas before
            we only had some significant portions (but apparently not
            all) of pass 1.&nbsp; I'm not entirely sure what all the new
            passes do in detail, but I'm pretty sure that the portions
            we had before got no farther than syntactical parsing,
            whereas we now have code-generation and optimization.&nbsp;
            Part of the problem in discussing it without having the
            opportunity to review the code in detail is that <a
              moz-do-not-send="true" href="Shuttle/19760020796.pdf">the
              documentation for the compiler system</a> does not discuss
            it in terms of "passes" (1, 2, 3, and 4), but rather in
            terms of "phases" (1, 1.5, 2, and 3).&nbsp; So your guess as
            to how these passes and phases correspond to each other is
            as good as mine at this point.&nbsp; ... Though having said
            that, an email has just rolled in that sheds some light, so
            I may come back to this issue later with some
            more-enlightening comments.<br>
            <br>
            Please inform me if you notice any oddities in these
            files.&nbsp; Some semi-automated conversions were needed (at
            least, in my less-than-humble opinion) to massage them from
            the form in which they were provided to me into the form in
            which you see them, and I'd certainly like to know if I
            managed to mess up the conversion somehow.<br>
            <br>
            Incidentally, if some industrious person wants to work out
            syntax highlighting for HAL/S (*.hal), XPL (*.xpl), and/or
            BAL (*.bal) source code for our GitHub repository, I
            certainly wouldn't look askance.&nbsp; I'd love to have it,
            but I suspect we'll be waiting indefinitely for it if I have
            to work it out myself.&nbsp; Yes, I know we have no flight
            software in HAL/S as the situation stands right now, but
            there's lots of other HAL/S source code there, geared at
            learning HAL/S, and learners can certainly benefit from
            syntax highlighting.<br>
            <br>
            Actually, I could say much the same for LVDC syntax
            highlighting (see <a moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="LVDC-transcription-instructions.html">the
              transcription guidelines</a> for vim-based LVDC syntax
            highlighting), but it would be depressing to do so when I
            can't actually post much LVDC source code to GitHub to
            benefit from such hypothetical syntax highlighting.&nbsp; <br>

          <td valign="top">Anyone following the LVDC-related news on
            this site is aware that due to ongoing uncertainty about the
            status of LVDC software under the U.S. regulations known as
            ITAR, we are presently restricting access to such software
            to those who are interested enough (and able) to
            individually present us with credentials demonstrating that
            they legally qualify as "U.S. persons".&nbsp; What that
            unfortunately means as well is that there are no links to
            the software on this site, and no updates in this change-log
            about whatever progress is being made on the internal
            processing we must do here with such software, to transcribe

            go through the demeaning process of proving they are
            "worthy" by accident of birth to look at the sacred software
            itself.&nbsp; So I'm toying with the idea of writing about

            largely or even entirely identical.&nbsp; (Admittedly, this

            only a measure of how the LVDC flight software was changing
            in the interval from Apollo 14 through 17, but more
            importantly, it means that many of the Apollo 14 LVDC

            <br>
            Well, when I say "suddenly" ... for you, perhaps; for me, it
            has been ongoing for the last 6 months, and has therefore
            seemed fraught with uncertainty and as slow as
            molasses.&nbsp; Not that it's anything I've achieved
            personally, you understand; naturally, Mike Stewart has been
            deeply involved, and hopefully I'll be able to provide
            fuller credits later when some of the dust has
            settled.&nbsp; But as they say, that makes no never mind
            now.&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="LVDC.html">The
              LVDC page</a> in general has thus been the recipient of
            substantial rewrites related to this sudden availability.<br>
            <br>
            As you may recall, the only LVDC source code available until
            now has been that for the so-called PTC ground-test
            equipment, along with the uncompleted, undebugged code for
            the unflown AS-206RAM mission.&nbsp; Whereas in contrast,
            the AS-512 and AS-513 Flight Programs are the final,
            actually-flown versions of the software!&nbsp; This is all
            so new that the write-up doesn't include much technical
            detail about the new listings.&nbsp; That'll have to wait
            for more-extensive analyses over time.&nbsp; Nor have
            transcriptions to source code <i>yet</i> been made, so we
            can neither assemble this code yet nor run it in the LVDC
            CPU emulator.<br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, you'll <i>also</i> recall that there has
            been uncertainty under U.S. law as to whether the AS-206RAM
            source code could be "exported" — i.e., posted online — and
            that I've reluctantly needed to hold it back from public
            view until these issues are resolved.&nbsp; That uncertainty
            obviously extends immediately to the AS-512 and AS-513
            Flight Program source code as well.&nbsp; I will release any
            or all of them to "U.S. persons" (i.e., U.S. citizens and
            some others who qualify) who apply to me directly, but alas
            that's little consolation to those of you who <i>don't</i>
            qualify.&nbsp; I deeply sympathize, and hope the situation
            changes for the better at some time in the future.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Important note</b>:&nbsp; If I've granted you access to
            the AS-206RAM software listing in the past, I'll happily
            grant you access to the "new" AS-512 and AS-513 software
            listings as well, without you having to go through the
            rigamarole of proving to me again that you're a "U.S.
            person".&nbsp; However, if you haven't received a
            notification of the new hyperlinks, you'll have to drop me a
            note reminding me to send them to you.&nbsp; Sorry for the
            inconvenience! <br>
            <br>
            The potential ITAR issue is particularly annoying insofar as
            it relates to integrating LVDC software into existing
            spaceflight simulation systems. That wasn't so important as
            long as the only surviving LVDC software was for AS-206RAM,
            but it's <i>extremely</i> irritating now that Apollo 17
            LVDC software is available.&nbsp; I have an unsatisfying but
            hopefully-feasible workaround for the problem.&nbsp; As I've
            mentioned here several times recently, I've been creating a
            compiler for the computer language (HAL/S) in which Space
            Shuttle flight software was written.&nbsp; Since the Shuttle
            flight software suffers (in my mind) from the same ITAR
            uncertainty afflicting LVDC code, I've been pursuing a
            strategy with the Shuttle compiler and emulator that might
            be applicable to the LVDC code as well.&nbsp; The basic idea
            of this strategy is that instead of compiling Shuttle code
            to the machine language of the Shuttle's computer system
            (IBM model AP-101S), I instead compile it to a different
            form (which I call PALMAT), and provide a PALMAT emulator
            that can run the compiled PALMAT.&nbsp; The significance is
            that even if flight-software source code or executable code
            for the AP-101S were restricted under ITAR, I see no reason
            in the world PALMAT code would be restricted; after all, one
            can neither recover the original source code nor produce
            usable AP-101S executable code starting from PALMAT.<br>
            <br>
            Similarly, if we had an assembler for LVDC source code that
            assembled to some form (let's call it LALMAT) <i>other</i>
            than LVDC machine language, and if we had an emulator for
            LALMAT, there would be no reason we couldn't export the
            LALMAT code from the U.S., and no reason under ITAR that we
            couldn't integrate the LALMAT emulator into
            spacecraft-simulation software such as Orbiter.&nbsp; Of
            course, LALMAT doesn't have to be something invented ... it
            could be something as simple as a translator from LVDC
            source code to (say) C source code.<br>
            <br>
            There are several drawbacks to this scheme, other than the
            obvious one that I'm no legal beagle and my legal opinion is
            worth the paper it's digitized on.&nbsp; Those drawbacks
            are:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>So far, no spaceflight-simulation folks have shown the
                slightest interest in this notion, so there's no
                guarantee they would even bother to integrate a LALMAT
                emulator even if it existed.</li>
              <li>We <i>might</i> end up finding out that it's
                perfectly okay with ITAR to export the actual LVDC
                source code anyway, in which case any development time
                spent on LALMAT would be wasted.</li>
              <li>As long as the LVDC source code remains restricted
                under ITAR (if it even <i>is</i> restricted), many of
                those people who would otherwise be most-enthusiastic
                about working with it have little motivation for
                participating in LALMAT development.<br>
              </li>
              <li>But mainly, I'm personally completely swamped, and
                there's no possibility of developing LALMAT myself as
                long as I'm neck-deep in Space Shuttle stuff.&nbsp;
                Developing LALMAT requires volunteers to do so.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I guess the executive summary is that if there are any
              "U.S. persons" keen to help transcribing the AS-512 and
              AS-513 listings into source code, and/or specifying LALMAT
              and coding an LVDC-to-LALMAT assembler and a
              high-performance LALMAT emulator, then you should make
              yourselves known!<br>

            today rather than for the 18th.&nbsp; Not that there was
            anything particularly wrong with the previous scan ... well,

          <td valign="top">Mike Stewart has sent over Volume II of the
            Apollo Operations Handbook for Lunar Module LM-2, which I've
            added to <a moz-do-not-send="true"
              href="links2.html#RecentAdditions">the library</a>.&nbsp;
            Recall that he also sent over Volume I about a month ago.<br>
            <br>
            One question I'm often asked is this:&nbsp; It's great and
            all that I can now run an AGC emulation, but what do I <i>do</i>
            with it?&nbsp; Or more bluntly: How do I use an AGC?&nbsp;
            To which my normal too-glib answer basically amounts
            to:&nbsp; Train to be an astronaut!&nbsp; Of course, this
            really is just a cover-up for the fact that I don't
            personally know how to use an AGC to do anything
            substantive.&nbsp; (To be fair to myself, I also normally
            point out that I'm a poor person of whom to ask that
            question.) <br>
            <br>
            Well ... call it stupidity, call it forgetfulness over the
            decades I've been involved in this, call it being
            overwhelmed, call it the sheer size and eclectic nature of
            these documents, along with the fact that we don't have just
            all that many of them — call it whatever you will — but for
            some reason I've been (or have become) blissfully unaware
            that one great charm of these Operations Handbooks for the
            AGC aficionado is that they contain detailed instructions
            for using the AGC, on a crew-member-by-crew-member and
            flight-phase-by-flight-phase basis.&nbsp; Those instructions
            appear in Volume II in general; look for sections titled
            "G&amp;C General Procedures" for the CSM or "Normal/Backup
            Procedures" for the LM.&nbsp; The LM version of the handbook
            also integrates AGS operating instructions alongside the AGC
            operating instructions.&nbsp; In the case of LM-2 (the
            volume added to the library today), look in section 8.6.<br>
            <br>
            Live and learn, I guess!&nbsp; Or perhaps "live and forget"
            might be a more-realistic appraisal, which is my excuse for
            dumping every little detail onto this site so that it
            hopefully cannot be forgotten as easily.<br>

            4 was pea soup.&nbsp; Bill Anders ate all of his.&nbsp;
            Frank Borman and Jim Lovell don't seem to have filled out

          <td valign="top">You may recall that about 4 months ago — <i>only</i>
            4 months? It seems like an eternity! — Mike had managed to
            obtain dumps from physical core-rope memory modules of the
            Block I AGC programs Sunrise 45 and Sunrise 69.&nbsp;
            Sunrise is one of a series of programs — the others being
            Sundial for the Block II AGC and Aurora for the LM AGC —
            whose principal claim to fame is that they were used for
            ground-acceptance and other testing of the Apollo spacecraft
            guidance-and-navigation systems.&nbsp; Thus not only is
            Sunrise one of our very few surviving Block I AGC programs
            (the other being Solarium), and indeed the oldest
            non-trivial AGC program available, but it's also darned
            useful for anyone interested in building their own Block I
            system.&nbsp; Because now you can test it!&nbsp; Not that
            collision between reality and your expectations will

            At any rate, I digress.&nbsp; The news today is that the AGC

            now been reconstructed, and is available on <a

            Here's his synopsis:<br>
            <blockquote>

                  scans of the Apollo Mission Simulator Instructor
                  Handbook, volumes I and II, which are already in the
                  library. Volume I is the same revision as the one in
                  the library, while Volume II is a slightly later
                  revision than the one we already have. The third is a
                  nifty little booklet about the Lunar Module
                  Environmental Control Subsystem by Hamilton Standard.
                  It's filled with lots of technical details, sketches,
                  and numbers, some of which we don't have from other
                  sources.<br>

            </blockquote>
            <font size="-1"></font>
            <div>Besides that, there is a Space Shuttle "document" that
              has been floating around for some time, but which I had
              resisted adding to the Shuttle library because I thought
              it was just a collection of pages from a another document
              in the library (namely IBM FSD document 85-C67-001, "Space
              Shuttle Model AP-101S Principles of Operation with Shuttle
              Instruction Set") for which somebody had been reviewing
              changes.&nbsp; But has been pointed out to me (thanks
              Hartmuth Gutsche!) that it contains material — a <i>lot</i>
              of material — found neither in the afore-mentioned
              document, nor in any other source presently available to
              us.&nbsp; This thing has no title, date, or author, so I
              can't even really tell if it's excerpted from a single
              document or from a variety of documents.&nbsp; At any
              rate, I've assuaged my guilt a tad by adding a few
              niceties to the document, such as searchable text and
              correctly oriented pages, and have now posted it in the <a

                something more-definitive than the vague comments
                previously on our Shuttle page, particularly as I will
                likely want help at some point turning this preliminary
                version of the compiler, and the associated emulator
                built into the interpreter, into an advanced form that
                can produce efficient Shuttle code and run it
                fast.&nbsp; That effort is actually something that could
                begin right now, if anybody was pounding on my door to
                help with it; or more helpful at this point, willing
                just to take it entirely under their own wing without
                interference from me!&nbsp; Alas, I still have received
                no <i>actual</i> HAL/S flight-software source code

            Actually, the newly-added document for today, the STS-114
            Flight Readiness Review (FRR) presentation, gives some
            interesting insights into the evolution of the Shuttle's
            onboard software that I at least hadn't seen before.&nbsp;
            Since we don't actually have any of the Shuttle's
            flight-software source code yet, it's all too easy to get
            into the habit of just thinking or talking about <i>the</i>
            Shuttle software, rather than admitting that there were many
            versions of it and that there were significant changes to
            the software over time into which we (unfortunately) have
            little visibility.&nbsp; However, this FRR gives a rough
            count of the pretty-substantial amount of code changed from
            STS-107 (OI-29) to STS-114 (OI-30), as well as a top-level
            summary of the nature of those change.&nbsp; In brief:<br>

            <br>
            In looking through these notes, I see that I've neglected to
            mention what I personally have been working on lately.&nbsp;
            Whilst awaiting the arrival of Shuttle flight-software
            source code on my doorstep — or more accurately, my inbox —
            and in lieu of a working version of the Shuttle-era HAL/S
            compiler, I've been writing a modern compiler and emulator
            for the HAL/S computer language.&nbsp; Recall that HAL/S was
            the high-level language — and a pretty sophisticated one at
            that — in which the Shuttle's Primary Flight Software (PFS)
            and Backup Flight Software (BFS) were written.&nbsp;
            Creating this compiler and emulator turns out to be quite a
            substantial effort, in which I'm increasingly thinking that
            I'll <i>eventually</i> want or need to enlist the help of
            other coders who are paying attention.<br>
            <br>
            But in spite of my probable long-term need for help, I'm
            still making good progress on it by myself.&nbsp; For my
            immediate engineering purposes, I'm actually combining the
            HAL/S compiler and emulator functionality in the form of a
            HAL/S interpreter, into which you can type HAL/S statements
            and immediately see the results from compiling and running
            that code.&nbsp; Yesterday was a big milestone for that, in
            that it was the first time I was able to see it produce some
            output ... admittedly, on a <i>very small</i> but still
            important subset of the HAL/S language.<br>
            <br>
            For illustrative purposes, here's a cut-and-paste of a short
            interactive session with the HAL/S interpreter:<br>
            <blockquote><tt>HAL/S &gt; DECLARE I INTEGER, X SCALAR, Y
                SCALAR;</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>HAL/S &gt; X = 50.26;</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>HAL/S &gt; Y = 100.92;</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>HAL/S &gt; I = 3 X - Y;</tt><tt><br>
              </tt><tt>HAL/S &gt; WRITE(6) 'The result of 3 X - Y,', 3 X
                - Y, ', converted to an integer, is:', I;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
                  color="#ff0000">The result of 3 X - Y, 49.86 ,
                  converted to an integer, is: 50</font> <br>
              </tt><tt>HAL/S &gt; </tt><br>
            </blockquote>
            I suppose it's obvious to you, but "<tt>HAL/S &gt; </tt>"
            is the user-prompt displayed by the interpreter, <tt><font
                color="#ff0000">the stuff in red</font></tt> is output
            by the emulator, and the rest of the stuff was what I typed
            in myself as input to the interpreter.&nbsp; As brief as
            this session is, you can still see various interesting
            features of HAL/S.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; It is strongly
            typed, and hence all variables must be <tt>DECLARE</tt>'d
            before use; floating-point types (or in HAL/S lingo, <tt>SCALAR</tt>
            types) are automatically rounded when assigned to <tt>INTEGER</tt>
            variables; there is no multiplication operator, and
            multiplication is done just by sticking things next to each
            other, as in <tt>3 X</tt>; and the <tt>WRITE(6)</tt>
            statement shows some clear inheritance from the FORTRAN
            language, even though HAL/S as a whole bears very little
            resemblance to FORTRAN.<br>

          <td valign="top">As you may recall — gosh, was it only two
            months ago?! — we were recently able to add dumps of the
            physical rope-memory modules for the SUNRISE 45 and SUNRISE
            69 programs to our so-called Rope Module Dump Library
            (RMDL).&nbsp; That was a big deal, though I guess not too
            much was made of it, because SUNRISE was the system-checkout
            software used for the Apollo Block I AGC, similar to what
            SUNDIAL was later for the Block II AGC or AURORA for the LM
            AGC. <br>
            <br>
            Another thing I appear not to have made a big deal of at the
            time was that <i>one</i> of those memory modules (out of
            the 3 for for SUNRISE 45 or 4 for SUNRISE 69) was
            exceptionally flawed in comparison to most of the
            rope-memory modules that had been dumped so far.&nbsp; While
            Mike was exceptionally motivated to find fixes for those
            flaws, due to the significance of the SUNRISE program, and
            was indeed able to do so in an effort that you might
            describe as a <i>tour de force</i>, it still gave us a tad
            less confidence than usual in the 100%-correctness standard
            to which we strive to adhere.&nbsp; Perhaps that's why I
            failed to really mention it at the time.&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; I
            don't think the omission was intentional on my part, but who
            knows?<br>
            <br>
            Fortunately, in this case karma has not turned out to be a
            bitch.&nbsp; A second physical instance of that problematic
            SUNRISE 45/69 rope-memory module — albeit with a different
            part number, 1003733-021 vs 1003133-20 — has now turned up
            and has been dumped.&nbsp; And lo-and-behold!&nbsp; The dump
            of this newer module agrees perfectly with all of Mike's
            corrections to the previously-dumped module.&nbsp; Our
            versions of SUNRISE 45 and SUNRISE 69 were correct all along
            ... but now we can know for sure that they really <i>are</i>
            correct, and can feel good about them.&nbsp; Many thanks to
            Larry McGlynn for giving us access to this newer module. <br>

              <li>I've added reference source code to the software

                in Space Shuttle software development.&nbsp; Recall that
                the Space Shuttle's HAL/S compiler is written in XPL.<br>
              </li>
              <li>I've also added partial source code to the repository,
                in a mixture of XPL and IBM Basic Assembly Language
                (BAL), for HAL/S-FC compiler release 32V0 (PASS 32.0 /
                BFS 17.0).&nbsp; This source-code batch, I believe,
                contains all compiler code except passes 2 through
                4.&nbsp; Thus it has code for stuff such as tokenizing,
                parsing, optimization, creating output listings, and the
                runtime library, but is missing code for executable-code
                generation and probably other stuff I'm not cognizant of
                at the moment.&nbsp; I also have related stuff in hand
                that I've omitted from the repository for now, like JCL,
                macros possibly related to digital simulation, and
                sample assembly listings of a few source files, because
                I'm not really too sure yet about what it all is or how
                to present it appropriately.&nbsp; I hope to add the
                missing passes 2-4 later so as to complete the source
                code, but those have not been supplied to me as of yet.<br>

                  the "Data Processing System Systems Brief"</a>.&nbsp;
                In Apollo terms, the most-direct comparison I'd draw is
                to the AC Electronics manuals that concisely presented
                any and all technical details about the guidance systems
                in one giant manual for each Apollo mission.&nbsp; The
                DPS Systems Brief plays a similar role for the Shuttle's
                computer systems.&nbsp; For example, it explicitly
                covers the details of database message packets received
                by the General Purpose Computers (GPC) or emitted by
                them, which is information I've really wanted but have

            88 exists merely as a rope-memory-module dump, so we do not
            yet have source code.&nbsp; Due to similarities with DAP
            AURORA 12 and SUNDIAL E, I expect that a reconstruction of
            the source code will be available in the not-too-distant
            future, though I don't promise any time-table for
            that.&nbsp; Mike normally — well, <i>always</i> — is the
            one doing these source-code reconstructions, but as you may
            well imagine from the fact that lots and lots of these
            memory dumps have been appearing lately, it's not as though

              <li>Nearly <i>three</i> years ago, Frank Pound sent me
                instructions for running the AGC CPU emulator (yaAGC) in
                a docker container.&nbsp; Now in this case, I didn't do
                anything about it because I wasn't sure exactly what I <i>should</i>
                do.&nbsp; So I've still done nothing with it now.&nbsp;
                But it's a very interesting idea, so I didn't want to
                retire it without at least blogging about it ... if this
                change-log is indeed a "blog".&nbsp; The difficulty with
                docker, as I understand it — and I'll freely admit that
                by now my understanding could be very out-of-date — is
                that while you can run a command-line program like yaAGC
                or yaAGS under docker, you can't run graphical programs
                like yaDSKY2.&nbsp; Frank's insight was that you can
                still run the graphical components like yaDSKY2 or
                yaDEDA natively, but that yaAGC or yaAGS can run in
                docker and still communicate with the graphical
                components normally.&nbsp; Since it's usually the
                graphical components that are difficult to port or build
                platform-independently, specifically on Mac OS X, I'm
                not sure what that gets you.&nbsp; On the other hand,
                these days, it's becoming more and more clear to me that
                the emulations of the graphical components can be done
                perfectly satisfactorily in Python, and much more easily
                than they have been done so far using other tools like
                wxWidgets, in which case they would be perfectly
                portable across any platforms that had Python; and which
                would make providing the command-line components like
                yaAGC as dockerfiles would be very sensible.&nbsp; Well,
                that's neither here nor there, since the various Virtual
                AGC graphical programs have <i>not</i> so far been
                turned into Python programs.&nbsp; And that assumes you
                can even run the Linux software in docker containers on
                Mac OS X or Windows. &nbsp;&nbsp; But it makes you
                think.&nbsp; Or at least, it make me think, and wish.</li>

            but rather on wires of a magnetic material called
            Permalloy.&nbsp; (The AGC's erasable memory, on the other
            hand <i>was</i> based on ferrite cores.)&nbsp;
            Unfortunately, I've been calling these things "ferrite
            cores" or "ferromagnetic" for years and years on this
            website and elsewhere, most recently in a presentation for a
            Paris workshop on software preservation that I gave last
            week.&nbsp; So I've been tracking down and fixing this
            incorrect phrasing.&nbsp; All except Paris, since that
            presentation is out of my hands now and can't be
            fixed.&nbsp; I'll always have Paris.&nbsp; By the way, I'm
            told that the video from the workshop from that will be
            online, one of these days, and when that happens I'll be
            sure to badger you with it here.<br>
            <br>
            Speaking of which, we now have lots and lots of data dumps
            taken from physical AGC rope-memory modules.&nbsp; And there
            are more that we think will be coming in the not-too-distant
            future.&nbsp; These are the modules, up to 6 of them per
            AGC, based on <i>Permalloy</i> magnetic cores, which hold
            the executable form of the AGC software.&nbsp; It will take
            a long time to process them for consumption, because
            wherever we have complete sets of modules, we want not
            merely to make the executables runnable in our AGC CPU
            emulator, but also to reconstruct the associated source
            code.&nbsp; So have patience!<br>
            <br>
            In the meantime, it's almost an embarrassment of
            riches.&nbsp; Since we have so many of these dumps now, I've
            created what I call a "<a moz-do-not-send="true"

              Dump Library</a>" (RMPL) to hold them.&nbsp; It's a part
            of our software repository, and includes every data dump
            from an AGC rope-memory module to which we have access, not
            merely these newest ones.&nbsp; Recall that we've had a
            number of such dumps in last couple of years, for programs
            like Retread 50, Sundial E, and Sundance, so they're all in
            the RMPL as well.&nbsp; I won't promise anything based on
            the dumps I think are coming Real Soon Now™, however
            confident I am of them, but among the things we definitely
            in hand right now, you'll see new AGC versions like:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>SUNRISE 45 <br>
              </li>
              <li>SUNRISE 69</li>
              <li>LM131 rev 1<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            As for SUNRISE, it's a Block I program, of which the only
            other example we had previously is SOLARIUM, and if I'm not
            mistaken it will become the earliest AGC program we have
            available, surpassing RETREAD in that respect.&nbsp; Our
            earliest revision of RETREAD is 44, with a printout dated
            July 1965, while my best estimate of SUNRISE 45 at the
            moment is November 1964.&nbsp; Realize that the earliest AGC
            software we're aware of is ECLIPSE 0 from July 1963, so this
            is really pushing close to the very beginning.&nbsp; I
            sympathize with those astronomers trying to push their
            observations back in time as close to the Big Bang as they
            can get them.&nbsp; It may seem as though this early
            software is a total mystery, but there's actually quite a
            lot of AGC documentation that's pretty specific to SUNRISE,
            including "<a moz-do-not-send="true"

            As for LM131 rev 1, it's the Lunar Module software for
            Apollo 13 ... which is ironic, because LUMINARY 131 was the
            <i>very first</i> AGC software I worked with back in 2003
            when the Virtual AGC Project began.&nbsp; And I had said for
            years that <i>it</i> was the Apollo 13 software; but in
            reality it was merely a release candidate for the
            mission.&nbsp; It was succeeded by LUM131 rev. 9 and then
            finally by LM131 rev. 1.&nbsp; The reason that's ironic is
            that this will complete (with a little bit of hand-waving
            about SUNDANCE 306 for Apollo 9) our entire set of flown
            Lunar Module AGC software; thus the first LM software we
            started with is superseded by the very last, and it turns
            out to be for the <i>same</i> mission.&nbsp; That's not to
            say that our task is over, of course. <img

            Up to this point, Mike Stewart has not only been performing
            all of these data dumps, but also performing all of the
            software reconstructions as well.&nbsp; I can only presume
            that it has to be a lot of effort, and I'd like to
            streamline it a bit.&nbsp; In a vain effort to assist him —
            or anyone else who wants to try his or her hand at it —
            there are some new software tools I've been creating for the
            last month or so that can imitate <i>some</i> of the
            more-routine things Mike is doing, but not all of fancier
            stuff he must be doing as well.&nbsp; You can find the
            tools, along with a big write-up of them and of my feeble
            attempts to imitate with them what Mike has been doing, in
            the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/tree/master/Tools/disassemblerAGC">Tools/disassemblerAGC/</a>
            folder of the software repository.&nbsp; In essence it's a
            disassembler and related tools for the different flavors of
            AGC software (Block I, BLK2, Block II), optimized for the
            kind of workflow that you'd likely employ in reconstructing
            source code for an AGC executable.&nbsp; Actually, if I do
            say so myself, the tools are quite impressive, though I'll
            have to make them much better to get into Mike's
            league.&nbsp; I can tell you that even with the tools it's
            not a walk in the park; if you want to experiment with them,
            be prepared for a bit of a mental gymnastic.<br>

              Gemini page</a> has contained many references to <a
              moz-do-not-send="true" href="LVDC.html">the LVDC</a> which
            are probably incorrect.&nbsp; This is due to the fact that
            the Gemini OBC and Apollo LVDC computers are so similar, and
            the descriptions on the Gemini page were written in such a
            way as to include the LVDC <i>prior</i> to the discovery of
            any OBC or LVDC source code.&nbsp; In other words, those
            descriptions were speculative in some ways.&nbsp; However,
            LVDC code has been known for some time now (about 3 years)
            and is known to differ from the descriptions on the Gemini
            page.&nbsp; So I've finally gotten around to scrubbing the
            Gemini page of those references to the LVDC, in those cases
            where I think they're probably wrong.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, if
            true OBC source code is ever discovered, the Gemini page
            will require major updates that probably bring it into
            closer alignment with the LVDC page.&nbsp; But for now,
            that's just speculation, and the Gemini page remains as-is,
            <i>sans</i> its bogus LVDC references.<br>

          <td valign="top">One reader commented that where I list the
            physical dimensions and weight of the AGC and DSKY only in
            imperial units, I'm doing a disservice to the vast majority
            of the world who have a much-better feel intuitively for the
            metric system rather than the (why are we still using it
            over here in the U.S.?) imperial system.&nbsp; (Thanks to
            Peter Hebden.)&nbsp; Well, that's completely right, of
            course.&nbsp; The way I rationalize such matters is to think
            to myself that the original Project Apollo (back in the day)
            used only English (so I don't have to translate anything
            into other languages), used only the imperial system (so I
            don't have to translate into metric), used only ... well,
            you get the idea.&nbsp; It's everyone for themselves in
            trying to understand just what was going on back then!&nbsp;
            <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="smiley.png" alt=""
              height="16" width="16">&nbsp; But I'm not as much of a
            fool as I seem to be, hopefully, so I actually did update
            the quoted dimensions accordingly.<br>
            <br>
            It got me to thinking, though, because I couldn't help but
            wonder just where I had gotten those original dimensions
            from anyway?&nbsp; Yes, they agree with Wikipedia's article
            on the AGC, but so what?&nbsp; Looking back through the
            history of that Wikipedia page (say, for mid-2005), it
            doesn't even yet list physical dimensions, even though it's
            already listing the Virtual AGC website as reference
            material.&nbsp; Perhaps when Wikipedia eventually started
            quoting dimensions, it may have gotten them from Virtual
            AGC, and here I am looking at Wikipedia to confirm that I
            got the dimensions right!&nbsp; What a vicious cycle it may
            be.&nbsp; Not to mention the fact that everyone else on the
            internet is doing the same thing.&nbsp; A thousand sources
            on the internet saying the same thing?&nbsp; Baloney!&nbsp;
            It may easily be one incorrect source being referenced
            directly or indirectly a thousand times.&nbsp; In this
            respect, safety in numbers is safety in baloney.<br>
            <br>
            So I bestirred myself to look instead at the original
            sources.&nbsp; Physical dimensions can be found in the
            engineering drawings.&nbsp; There's no guarantee, without
            taking more effort than I like, that the dimensions are all
            the same from one mission to the next, so I settled on using
            just the Apollo 11 LM drawings, which happen to be drawing
            2003993 for the AGC and 2003956 for the DSKY.&nbsp; As for
            weights, I'm sure that somewhere in the original acceptance
            process somebody must have recorded the actual weights of
            the Apollo 11 AGC and DSKY, but unfortunately I don't know
            where that might be.&nbsp; However, the "Weight &amp;
            Balance Report" of April 1, 1968 does list the weights as of
            that point in time.&nbsp; The net result of all that
            research boils down to the following changes:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>AGC:&nbsp; 24"×12.5"×6" → 24.250"×12.433"×5.974" and
                70.1 pounds (which stays the same).</li>
              <li>DSKY:&nbsp; 8"×8"×7" → 8.124"×8.000×6.91" and 17.5
                pounds → 17.8 pounds.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thus, in one respect, almost everything changed.&nbsp;
              But you can't really say the original numbers were
              "wrong"; everything turned out to basically correct, as
              long as you know to round to the nearest half-pound or
              half-inch.&nbsp; Which is something neither I nor
              Wikipedia, nor anybody else thought to mention.&nbsp; <br>
            </p>
            <p>But it does point out a problem with the Virtual AGC
              website, in that I occasionally (often? usually?) just
              don't say where the individual factoids come from.&nbsp; I
              can't help but wonder if the website doesn't need a
              complete review of the provenance of the information and
              (perhaps) a bunch of supporting footnotes, factoid by
              factoid, like Wikipedia has.&nbsp; Since I'm lazy, I'm
              going to have to ponder that for a while rather than doing
              anything about it immediately.<br>

              to slightly improve the representation of engineering
              drawings in the document library.&nbsp; The problem with
              representing engineering drawings in the the context of
              the library is that there are hundreds of thousands of
              such engineering drawings, but those many individual
              drawings can't be presented well in the document library,
              which is essentially just a list of documents that you can
              scroll through.&nbsp; Nobody wants to scroll through
              hundreds of thousands of drawings.&nbsp; Or for that
              matter, load a page having hundreds of thousands of links
              into a browser!&nbsp; Just the few thousand documents the
              library already has is slow enough!&nbsp; So in the past,

              most of our engineering drawings originally came from

              so the improvement to the library is that it <i>now</i>
              lists each of the aperture-card boxes that has already
              been scanned, along with the range of drawing numbers in
              each of those boxes.&nbsp; That's feasible, since each box
              only holds ~1800 slides, so there are many less boxes than
              there are drawings, and it doesn't clog up the document
              library page to list them all.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Admittedly this is a minor improvement that isn't of
              enormous use right now.&nbsp; But that's partially because
              scanning the aperture-card boxes was put on hold a couple
              of years ago due to the pandemic, so no new boxes of scans
              have been added to our website for a long time.&nbsp; When
              scanning eventually resumes, however, any newly scanned
              boxes will now show up in the document library's "recent
              additions" and will have <img src="new.png" alt=""
                height="16" width="36"> badges, just like any other
              newly-added document in the library does.&nbsp; That
              wouldn't have happened before.<br>

            focusing on ACE (Acceptance Checkout Equipment) and GSE
            (Ground Support Equipment).&nbsp; Here's Mike's summary of
            them:<br>
            <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;
              charset=UTF-8">
            <ul>
              <li>The ACE-S/C Operator's Manual, dated June 1, 1966. We
                already have a scan of the initial release of this
                document -- this appears to be the first revision after
                that one.</li>
              <li>ACE-S/C Operator Course Study Guides. This is a much
                larger document that goes into much more detail about
                how the Acceptance Checkout Equipment actually works.</li>
              <li>OCP-B-63005-LTA-8, Checklist and Procedure - Vehicle
                Support Systems Installation Chamber B. This is the
                as-run procedure used to wire up LTA-8 to all of the
                associated ground support equipment in its
                thermal-vacuum test.</li>
              <li>LPC 4-1, Procedure for the Preparation and Processing
                of the Test Preparation Sheet... a charmingly named
                procedure to prepare the sheet that you use to prepare
                for a test. Notably for us, it includes a listing of
                numeric "Spacecraft Categories" (e.g. 280 = Vehicle
                Structure), and so it can be used as a partial decoder
                for Grumman engineering drawings in which the first
                three digits after the LDW are this category.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For whatever reason, the ACE-S/C Operator Course Study
              Guides seemed rather compelling, though I can't give you
              any good reason for saying so.&nbsp; Fortunately, I was
              able to tear my attention away from it long enough to
              write this little note you're reading right now.<br>
            </p>
            <p>I did notice while doing so that the ACE-S/C Operator's
              Manual, along with the earlier revision of it that were
              already in the library, remain uncategorized.&nbsp; I.e.,
              they appear in the library only in the vast section
              (entitled "Everything") that enumerates all of the
              documents in the library, rather than in any of the much
              smaller special-purpose sections like "Programmers'
              Manuals", "Math Flow", or "Digital Group Memos".&nbsp; So
              you'd never find such uncategorized documents without a
              text search.&nbsp; I can't help wonder how many of the
              2600+ documents filed in the library are like this?<br>
            </p>
            <p>But wait!&nbsp; Why wonder, when I can just do a little
              software magic to find out? (... Time passes ....)&nbsp;
              If you look in <a href="links2.html#Everything">the
                library's Everything</a><a> section</a> from now on,
              you'll find that uncategorized documents appearing only in
              the library section are marked with the emoji 😮, and that
              there's a summary at the very end of the section of how
              many such documents there are.&nbsp; As of this moment, it
              turns out that there are 584 inadequately-categorized
              documents out of 2639 total.&nbsp; Quite a lot.&nbsp; But
              not as bad as I feared.<br>

            While I can't claim to understand <i>all</i> of the

            sticking out of the bottom of the spacecraft and aimed at
            the ocean seems just as relevant to America in 2022 as it
            did in 1965.&nbsp; So those of us who are worrying that

            More of the same, but this time for the LM! These three
            documents are all Elementary Functional Diagrams from
            Grumman, which were the equivalent of NAA's Functional
            Integrated System Schematics. Just like their CSM
            counterparts, they are schematic redrawings&nbsp;that show
            LM wiring down to the connector and pin number. The LM
            groups covered are:
            <ul>
              <li>LTA-8 (thermal-vacuum testing)</li>
              <li>LM-7, 8, and 9 (Apollo 13, 14, and the unflown LM on

              <li>LM-10 and subsequent (Apollo 15+)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>[To Mike's comments, I'd add that while a lot of folks
              would think it's natural to just skip the LTA-8 version
              and move right on to the Apollo 13+ versions, the LTA-8
              version is in far better shape than the other two
              versions.&nbsp; So where the documents overlap, it may
              still be worthwhile consulting the LTA-8 version even if

                  on the topic</a> in our GitHub repository's issue
                list.</li>

            <p>Obviously the dream (in lieu of finding a better copy of
              the document) would be a fully-legible transcription of
              it.&nbsp; Whether that will ever happen, I can't
              say.&nbsp; It turns out there actually is a prospect for
              getting a better copy of the document, but that prospect
              is vague, without any definite roadmap for doing so, so I
              wouldn't hold my breath!<br>
            </p>
            <p>On a completely different topic (but also thanks to
              "jumpjack"), I've set up a feature in our GitHub
              repository called "Discussions".&nbsp; <a

                AGC Discussions on GitHub</a> work like a souped-up
              version of our Virtual AGC mailing list, which frankly has
              been a source of problems over the years.&nbsp; So if I
              can move away from the mailing list to something that's
              not only better but also less of a problem for me, it's a
              win-win!&nbsp; Admittedly, since I just now set it up,
              there's no content on it yet other than my welcoming
              thread.&nbsp; There are bound to be some teething
              problems.&nbsp; Anyway, I invite you to use it.<br>

            here's Mike Stewart's synopsis:<br>

              charset=UTF-8">
            <ul>
              <li>A partial revision to the SA-513/SL-1 Launch Mission
                Rules Input Document. While it's not the full version,
                it is interesting in that it is first document of this
                type for us.</li>
              <li>Revision H of V34-90001, the Elementary Functional
                Integrated System Schematics for the Block II Design
                Reference Mission. We already have the later and more
                accurate revision K, but this early one shows some
                interesting differences along the development history of
                the CSM.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Besides that, you may notice that there's a digital
              simulation of an Apollo 11 landing that appears among the
              recent additions to the library.&nbsp; But don't get
              excited, because it's not new.&nbsp; It's simply that I've
              been told (thanks to correspondent "jumpjack") that the
              PDF I had formerly linked as the preferred document
              version was unreadable.&nbsp; Consequently, I've
              substituted a link to a more-legible version.&nbsp; But
              it's the same physical hardcopy and scan.<br>

                <li>Control Electronics Section and Abort Guidance
                  Section. The AGS section is very good, and includes a
                  large 2D foldout of the AEA architecture as well as
                  descriptions of all of the instructions.</li>

                <li>Propulsion and RCS</li>

                <li>Structures, Mechanical Systems, and
                  Electroexplosive&nbsp;Devices</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I realized belatedly that perhaps the Document Library
                should have <a href="links2.html#StudyGuides">an entire
                  section dedicated to training and study guides</a>,
                which it has lacked so far.&nbsp; So I've added
                one.&nbsp; Whether all (and only) the appropriate
                documents have been included in that section is
                debatable, and probably will have to be tweaked over
                time.&nbsp; On the other hand, you could probably say
                that about all of the other sections in the library as
                well.<br>
              </p>
              <p>On an only-slightly-related note, I've also realized
                belatedly that in some of the library sections organized
                principally by publication date, it would be slightly
                less confusing if undated documents were specifically
                marked as being undated (as opposed merely to not
                showing a date).&nbsp; So I've added that little feature
                as well.&nbsp; Beyond that, the primary culprit in this
                confusing-organization regard is <a
                  href="links2.html#Everything">the Everything section
                  of the library</a>, which is organized by date but
                contains literally thousands of entries; to that section
                <i>only</i>, I've added horizontal lines between year
                changes as (hopefully!) gentle guidance to the eye.<br>

            <ul>
              <li>Regarding the AGS, there have been a couple of
                changes, both thanks to a reader identifying themself as
                "spacex15":</li>
              <ul>
                <li>A potential fix has been put into place for a bug in
                  the treatment by yaAGS (the Abort Guidance System's
                  CPU emulator) of overflow in the 'MPR' opcode.&nbsp; I
                  say "potential" merely because the AGS documentation
                  is not extensive enough to unambiguously tell us that
                  the fix is fully correct.&nbsp; But I've been told
                  that the bug affects radar updates by the AGS in
                  NASSP, and that the fix fixes that (or at least makes
                  it better than it was), so I'm inclined to think the
                  change is a pretty good one.</li>
                <li>The encoding of the decimal integer -1 and the fixed
                  point number -1.0 differ from each other in the AGS,
                  and this explains a discrepancy in the documentation
                  of how the AGS encodes -1 that I had written a few
                  nasty words about on the AGS web-page.&nbsp; Well, <i>semi</i>-nasty.&nbsp;

































































































































































                  Well, not gushing with praise.&nbsp; Well, I had said
                  the AGS documentation was <i>wrong</i>.&nbsp; So I've
                  toned down my language a tad to simply point out the
                  reason for the documentation's discrepancy, rather
                  than applying the W-word to it.<br>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>I've been told (thanks Thymo van Beers!), and verified
                for myself, that certain hyperlinks on the website have
                stopped working in the last week or so.&nbsp; I refer to
                links that are targeted at folders on the website, as
                opposed to specific files on the website, thus allowing
                you to see the contents of the folders for yourself
                without my having to go to the effort of creating
                web-pages.&nbsp; For example, a couple of weeks ago, <a
                  href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/listings/">a
                  hyperlink like this one</a> would have allowed you to
                browse the contents of a folder that contains all of the
                colorized, syntax-highlighted listings of AGC software
                we've transcribed ... whereas now, it just gives a "403
                Forbidden" error.&nbsp; To be clear, the files
                themselves are still accessible from hyperlinks to them
                on our web-pages; it's just that you can't browse
                through them on your own by viewing the folder's
                directory listing.&nbsp; Fortunately, there aren't too
                many links like this that people would find helpful, so
                for most people this is probably not even an
                inconvenience; but for some it's a real
                irritation.&nbsp; Presumably this is some change
                ibiblio.org has made globally for security reasons, and
                I don't immediately have any workaround for it.&nbsp; <a
href="https://virtualagc.github.io/virtualagc/listings/">The "staging"
                  version of the website</a> exhibits the same problem,
                so presumably GitHub is using the same webserver
                security restrictions in this regard as ibiblio.&nbsp;
                At any rate, the problem has been kicked upstream to
                ibiblio.org's support team.&nbsp; Hopefully they'll be
                able respond (some day) with helpful information, at
                which point the links will start working again.&nbsp;
                For now, though, I fear it's just something that must be
                endured.</li>
              <li> On a more-pleasant note, a couple of Grumman
                documents Mike Stewart got from somewhere have been
                added to <a href="links2.html#RecentAdditions">the
                  document library</a>:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>OCP-B-90000-B-1, the LTA-8 Manrating Test. This is
                  the full test procedure for the 1968 manned thermal
                  vacuum tests of LTA-8 in Houston's Chamber B.</li>
                <li>OCP-B-90008-LM-2, the LM-2 Landing Simulation Test
                  Post Test Baseline -- which is a confusing title. In
                  April 1968, LM-2 underwent a drop test. After being
                  attached to the drop fixture, it underwent a full
                  system functional test to establish vehicle health. It
                  was then dropped to simulate a landing, and then
                  essentially the same test was run again to make sure
                  everything still worked correctly after the shock and
                  stresses of a simulated landing. This as-run procedure
                  is for that post-drop functional retest.</li>

          <td valign="top">Sometimes I have to marvel at my own
            stupidity.&nbsp; A while back, John Pultorak (of AGC Block 1
            simulator fame) had been working on a Gemini On-Board
            Computer (OBC) simulator along the same lines as his Block 1
            AGC simulator.&nbsp; 10+ years ago, he sent me a trio of
            documents on the subject, which over time I managed to
            forget all about.&nbsp; So today, as I was trying to do a
            little reorganization of my home office and happened to come
            across a printout of one of these documents, I was a bit
            surprised.&nbsp; Or perhaps "stunned" is a better
            word.&nbsp; After an interval in which I occupied myself by
            saying "Whaaaaat?!!!" in a foolish manner, it eventually
            occurred to me to dig back into the original correspondence
            with John, whereupon I found (hopefully) all the related
            documents, and have added them to the document
            library.&nbsp; You can see them <a
              href="links2.html#RecentAdditions">at the top of the list
              of recent additions</a>.&nbsp; In brief, though, there's:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>John's description of the actual OBC architecture.</li>
              <li>His description of his own simulator for it, which he
                called the Simple Gemini Spacecraft Computer
                (SGSC).&nbsp; His is a hardware simulation rather than a
                software simulation, so his description includes circuit
                diagrams rather than software.<br>
              </li>
              <li>An extremely brief coding example of how to assemble
                OBC assembly-language into a form in which it can be
                executed on is simulator.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since John didn't provide an assembler, his coding
              example is hand assembled.&nbsp; Of course, <i>we</i>
              have an OBC assembler, though I doubt it's in as debugged
              a form as our LVDC assembler.&nbsp; Still, I'm sure it
              could be pepped up to a 100% working state, if anyone
              chooses to build the OBC simulator and wants to run some
              code on it.&nbsp; By the same token, I suppose you could
              adapt John's OBC simulator into an LVDC assembler, and
              that might be even better.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Either an OBC or LVDC hardware simulator would be of
              great use in debugging our software-based OBC/LVDC
              simulators.&nbsp; It wasn't until Mike Stewart came along
              with his Block II AGC hardware simulation and ran it
              side-by-side with our software AGC simulator that we (well
              ... to be honest, <i>he</i>) was truly able to ring the
              bugs out of both of them.<br>

              href="yaDSKY.html#The_Warning_or_Indicator_Lamps">the
              yaDSKY page</a> I depicted the indicator lamps of the
            Apollo 15-17 LM's DSKY as differing from those of Apollo
            11-14.&nbsp; The difference was that there were 2 (out of
            14) indicator lamps unused in Apollo 11-14, whereas those 2
            were the NO DAP and PRIO DISP warnings in Apollo
            15-17.&nbsp; But then, 2-3 years ago, we acquired the actual
            DSKY engineering drawings for Apollo 15-17, and what did
            they show?&nbsp; Two unused indicators in Apollo 15-17, with
            no NO DAP or PRIO DISP indicators, just like in Apollo
            11-14!&nbsp; You can't argue with engineering drawings, so I
            dutifully changed the yaDSKY page to match the engineering
            drawings, with the Apollo 11-17 LM DSKYs all being exactly
            the same in terms of their indicator lamps.<br>
            <br>
            I should of stayed in bed that day.&nbsp; Fabrizio
            Bernardini (thanks Fabrizio!) has pointed out that the
            contemporary documentation for Apollo 15-17 says that the NO
            DAP and PRIO DISP legends were added to the LM DSKY by means
            of decals, as opposed to being directly engraved or printed
            or whatever technique was used to get the legends onto the
            other indicators.&nbsp; Presumably the decals were applied
            after the manufacturing described by the DSKY engineering
            drawings.&nbsp; In other words, yes there were NO DAP and
            PRIO DISP indicators in Apollo 15-17, in spite of the
            drawings.&nbsp; Stupid old me!&nbsp; So naturally I've now
            changed the yaDSKY page yet again, hopefully correctly this
            time.<br>
            <br>
            The good news is that back when I changed the yaDSKY page
            before, I apparently forgot to update the VirtualAGC GUI
            software ... so <i>it</i> continued to have the NO DAP and
            PRIO DISP indicators all along, and doesn't need to be fixed
            now.&nbsp; Two wrongs ended up making a right.<br>

            mightn't be too interested in PCRs, and might be
            doubly-uninterested in just lists of PCRs without even
            having the PCRs themselves.&nbsp; Why would we want them,
            other then from pure obsessiveness?&nbsp; (Or is it
            compulsiveness?&nbsp; Or perhaps some less flattering, but
            even more dismissive buzzword?)&nbsp; From my own
            perspective, the PCRs, PCNs, and Software Anomaly Reports
            are the principal resources you have, other than the
            memory-bank checksums, when you're forced into the position
            of having to reconstruct an AGC software version because you
            haven't an actual listing of the source code.&nbsp; Even
            just the title of the PCR (without the text) can be very
            useful.&nbsp; How it works is this:&nbsp; From the
            PCR/PCN/Anomaly (or even just its title), you may be able to
            isolate which portions of the AGC code are relevant.&nbsp;
            For example, if a PCR's title is about something called <tt>THROTLAG</tt>,
            there are only a few portions of any given AGC program that
            deal with <tt>THROTLAG</tt>. &nbsp; If you have earlier
            version of AGC code in which the PCR has not been
            implemented, as well as a later version in which the PCR has
            been implemented, you can then compare them to see how they
            differ.&nbsp; You then can pull the <tt>THROTLAG</tt>-related
















































































































































































            changes into the software revision you're trying to
            reconstruct.&nbsp; <i>Voila</i>!&nbsp; Your reconstruction
            now has corrected <tt>THROTLAG</tt> code!&nbsp; In practice
            it's often much trickier than that, but that's the basic
            idea.<br>
            <br>
            Yes, it's not something everyone would be excited by.&nbsp;
            Personally, I dread it.&nbsp; But in this kind of digital
            archaeology you work with what you have, and not with the
            material you wished you had.&nbsp; Think of it like gold
            mining:&nbsp; You'd naturally <i>prefer</i> to just find
            big chunks of gold sitting on the ground.&nbsp; But if you
            instead find a vein of gold that requires a lot of digging,
            that might not be too bad either, if you can find enough of
            it!<br>

            overhauled reasonably drastically.&nbsp; For some reason, I

            Anomalies, and not just those for which we currently have
            copies in the library, and not just those which had been
            "approved" back in the day.&nbsp; For one thing, showing all
            of them gives a better picture not only of the great
            evolutionary sweep of the AGC software, but also gives a
            better idea of where the gaps in our coverage are.&nbsp;
            Maybe.&nbsp; Regardless, it's pretty impressive to see them
            all sitting there in one big lump.<br>
            <br>
            This has greatly increased the number of PCRs/PCNs listed,
            which in turn has made me recognize some limitations in how
            I was displaying them.&nbsp; One action I've taken is to
            prefix a short characterization to the front of each PCR/PCN
            entry telling which AGC program the entry applies to:&nbsp;
            SUNDISK, SUNDANCE, COLOSSUS, LUMINARY, or SKYLARK.&nbsp; By
            the way, SUNDISK, you may recall, was the software for
            Apollo 7.&nbsp; The Software Control Board meeting minutes
            at which SUNDISK PCRs were approved notes the event as
            follows, closely mirroring my own reactions:<br>
            <blockquote><font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier,
                monospace"><u>SUNDISK PCR’s Approved at SCB ! ! !</u><br>
                <br>
                There was a flurry of excitement among SCB members when
                a SUNDISK PCR was introduced. The excitement subsided
                when the members found out that only the GSOP was being
                changed.</font><br>
            </blockquote>
            With software anomalies, on the other hand, I find that the
            entries are easier to locate when sorted by document number
            (which they are, as of today) rather than by date (as they
            had been), and that the "titles" for many of them were
            susceptible to some improvement.<br>
            <br>
            On a more-general note, the tag <img src="new.png" alt=""
              height="16" width="36"> that I used to put next to "new"
            documents in the library has now returned after a hiatus of
            about a month.&nbsp; I had removed these tags when I added a
            "Recent Additions" section to the library.&nbsp; In removing
            them, what I failed to realize is that while it was true
            that the recent-additions section <i>itself</i> didn't need
            any additional bling to highlight which files were new, all
            of the remaining sections in the library could still benefit
            from them.&nbsp; For example, if you were looking at just
            the PCR/PCN section of the library, it would be nice to see
            which PCRs had recently been acquired, without having to
            consult the recent-additions section.&nbsp; Now you
            can.&nbsp; On the good side, though, since the
            document-library page is now auto-generated, there's no
            danger of the <img src="new.png" alt="" height="16"
              width="36"> badges getting out of hand by endlessly
            proliferating and never being removed, as they had before;
            they will die off and disappear naturally as time passes,
            and thus are rather harmless other than whatever bandwidth
            and page-load time they consume.&nbsp; I've also shortened
            up the time scale, so that documents are only "new" for two
            months after they're added, rather than for three.&nbsp; But
            that's not exactly set in stone and I could change my mind
            later.&nbsp; In the short time that we've had the
            recent-additions section, I've waffled all over the place,
            using a timescale as long as 6 months and as short as 1

          <td valign="top">On a whim, I decided to make a huge chart
            showing all of the revisions of every AGC and AGS program,
            starting from ECLIPSE and RETREAD, and flowing through to
            SKYLARK, showing what programs branch from what revisions of
            what other programs, and what PCRs/PCNs/etc. went into
            making one revision from another.&nbsp; Admittedly, while we
            have a <i>lot</i> of the information needed for making the
            chart, there's a lot of information missing too, and hence
            quite a lot of guesswork ... and thus likely quite a lot of
            error if you focus on the minute detail.&nbsp; Still, it
            ended up being an impressive bit of eye candy by my
            standards, and probably catches the spirit of the
            development effort pretty well.&nbsp; (If you want to point
            out my errors, please do so; but supply documentation to
            prove your points, please.)&nbsp; You can check it out in <a
              href="links2.html#AssemblyListings">the Software Listings
              section of the Document Library</a>.&nbsp; The chart is
            about 40× taller than its width, so I considered turning it
            into an animation that continually scrolls from top to
            bottom, possibly while playing impressive music. &nbsp;<img

            Ultimately, I decided that that could be a bit of overkill;

            have to do so manually.<br>

              <li> It had been pointed out to me that I had been playing
                fast and loose with the naming of certain AGC software
                revisions, and that this could lead to confusion ...
                particularly confusion as to flight software, which is
                the worst kind of confusion.&nbsp; So I've hopefully
                fixed up the Luminary and Colossus pages to cover up my
                <i>faux pas</i> in this regard.&nbsp; The specifics are
                that the flight programs MANCHE45, MANCHE72, LUM69,
                LMY99, and LM131 (and the development software LUM131)
                for Apollos 10, 11, and 13 were not, strictly speaking,
                revisions of COMANCHE and LUMINARY, but were rather
                side-development branches from them, and thus bear
                different program names and incompatible revision
                levels.&nbsp; Indeed, LUM131 was branched from LUMINARY
                131, and then LM131 was branched (again!) from
                LUM131.&nbsp; It makes for a more-confusing story, but a
                more-accurate one than I (and some of the contemporary
                memos) had been telling.<br>

                  documents</a> today.&nbsp; Actually, not a single one
                of them is truly <i>new</i> to the library.&nbsp; It's
                just that I belatedly realized that over time I had
                accumulated quite a few PDFs which were lacking
                searchable text.&nbsp; So I've added searchable text to
                them, and now they're interpreted as being "new".&nbsp;
                In point of fact, I did this to every PDF file on the
                website that needed it, not just those in the
                library.&nbsp; Ultimately, 716 PDF files in all were
                fixed up; but only 232 of them show up among the
                recently added to the Document Library, which is about
                8% of the library.&nbsp; The principal advantage to
                having searchable text is that these files will now show
                up more usefully in our Google search bar (at the top of
                every page of the website).&nbsp; As it happens, they
                showed up in the search results even <i>before</i> I
                added searchable text to them, but if they were hundreds
                of pages long they were simply useless once you opened
                them up locally because you could never search within
                them to find what Google had promised you they
                contained.&nbsp; I guess that Google must do its own
                OCR'ing process when it finds unsearchable PDFs, even
                though it ends up being of limited use when your
                documents are longer than 1-2 pages.&nbsp; This will be
                better.</li>
              <li>For reasons with which I won't bore you, I've put
                together a table of all AGC programs/revisions which I
                could find had been released for manufacturing of their
                core-rope memory modules.&nbsp; This table is pretty
                big, and I've added it to the lead-in for the <a
                  href="links2.html#AssemblyListings">Assembly Listings
                  section of our Document Library</a>.&nbsp; If I recall
                correctly, nearly 75 software revisions of Luminary,
                Colossus, and other programs like Skylark, Sundance, and
                so on, were manufactured as ropes; leaving 500-1000
                revisions for which ropes were <i>not</i>
                manufactured.&nbsp; (Recall that there were 210
                revisions of Luminary, 249 of Colossus 1, 108 of
                Colossus 2, 72 of Colossus 3, 88 of Aurora, ..., well,

          <td valign="top">For some time, we've realized that the
            listing we have of the AGC program AURORA 12 really
            represents quite a late stage of AURORA development rather
            than a very early stage ... in spite of the fact that AURORA
            85 and 88 were the endpoint.&nbsp; But for some reason, I
            had neglected to alter the description on the Luminary page
            — and now on the Document Library page — to reflect this
            understanding.&nbsp; So I've done that now.&nbsp; The
            executive summary is that what I've been calling "AURORA 12"
            all this time, is not really AURORA at all.&nbsp; Rather, it
            was forked from the true AURORA program at AURORA 86 or 87,
            and then new code was added to it without materially
            affecting those areas of the program of particular interest
            to us ... i.e., the AGC self-test software.&nbsp; On a
            go-forward basis, I'm now calling this forked program "DAP
            AURORA" to help avoid some of the confusion.&nbsp; So what
            we have is DAP AURORA 12 rather than AURORA 12.<br>

                descriptions on the Colossus page and the Document
                Library page accordingly.&nbsp; (In brief, I have
                belatedly noticed that Table 4-I of report R-700, vol.

                list of log sections in the program, and how many words
                of memory each of them took.&nbsp; I've added this info
                the Colossus page ... which now that it's Kondoized,
                doesn't affect the comfort in navigating the page.&nbsp;

            A word to the wise, however:&nbsp; Most of the documents
            added today are simply old files that appeared on one or the
            other of our web-pages, but which I had neglected to put
            onto the Document Library page itself.&nbsp; In other words,
            while most of them are new to the Document Library page,
            they are not new to Virtual AGC more broadly.&nbsp; The
            documents that really <i>are</i> new today are the ones
            from the "Apollo Guidance Computer Information Series", of
            which we already had a handful, but now have two hands full
            and two feet full as well.&nbsp; I've also tagged them, at
            least temporarily, so that they also show up in the
            "Programmer's Manuals" section of the library.<br>

          <td valign="top">I've finished up drafting the structure of <a
              href="links2.html">the replacement page</a> for <a
              href="links.html">the current Document Library page</a>
            which I've been working on, as well as database entry of all
            items currently in our library.&nbsp; In other words, the
            new page is "complete" and "ready to go", except that
            there's a lot of double-checking that needs to be done
            before I have any intention of swapping it in.&nbsp; At a
            first glance, the new page looks pretty similar to the old
            one, but there are a number of improvements that I hope will
            make the whole thing easier to navigate.&nbsp; Here are some
            of the improvements that occur to me off the top of my head:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>The old page was very unsystematic in how it presented
                bibliographic entries, whereas the new page is perfectly
                regular in how it formats entries ... within the
                constraint, of course, that the information it wants
                display doesn't always exist.<br>
              </li>
              <li>New entries are easier to find.&nbsp; No more
                foolish&nbsp;<img src="new.png" alt="" height="16"
                  width="36"> icons!&nbsp; Instead, there's simply a
                section (Recently Added Documents) that lists the last
                couple months of items, from newest to oldest.&nbsp;
                Which means that I can also stop listing the
                "significant" new entries here in this change log.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Items may appear in several relevant sections of the
                library, if they're all relevant, rather than just
                appearing in whatever (single) section I had a whim to
                put it.&nbsp; (And then being unfindable if I had chosen
                poorly.)&nbsp; For example, the Apollo 17
                guidance-equation document would appear both in the
                section on guidance equations and the section on Apollo
                17, and maybe in other sections as well.</li>
              <li><i>All</i> of the documents on the Virtual AGC site
                are included, whereas before, some very important items
                like the AGC program listings appeared only on the
                LUMINARY and COLOSSUS pages, and didn't show up on the
                library page at all.&nbsp; Similarly for the engineering
                drawings such as the AGC or DSKY electrical
                schematics.&nbsp; If you were to look (say) at the
                Apollo 17 section on the replacement document-library
                page, you'd find <i>all</i> documentation we have about
                Apollo 17, including the electrical and mechanical
                diagrams for the AGC/DSKY (and the remainder of the
                Apollo 17 G&amp;N system) and the AGC and AGS software
                listings.</li>
              <li>The replacement page has more information about the
                documents than the old page, but doesn't insist on
                cluttering your screen with a lot of it.&nbsp; For
                example, if you can hover the mouse cursor over the link
                for a document, a small pop-up will tell you the
                download size and who contributed the document to
                us.&nbsp; No more enormous screen space taken up by my
                profuse thanks to people you've never heard of!&nbsp;
                The thanks are still there, but fat less intrusive.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And so on.&nbsp; I won't continue to rant about it, since
              if you're not interested, you won't care, and if you are
              interested, you can certainly discover whatever you like
              or don't like about it yourself.&nbsp; My point was simply
              that the thing looks remarkably similar to the old thing,
              but seems to me to be greatly improved.&nbsp; And
              certainly easier for me to maintain.&nbsp; Which is good,
              since I've fallen behind again in adding new documents,
              whilst I was spending all that time reworking the
              document-library page from scratch!<br>

            ways I won't bore you with until it's ready to go.&nbsp;<img
              src="smiley.png" alt="" height="16" width="16"> <i>But</i>,
            the process of doing that has turned up a number of
            instances in which I was guilty of some pretty shoddy
            handling of the material that was entrusted to me.&nbsp;
            I've been handling some clean-ups of those situations in the
            background, even though some of them do eat up the time
            quite a bit.&nbsp; At the moment, I just want to point out a
            couple of notable instances:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Over 16 years ago, Fabrizio Bernardini had sent in
                images of Apollo 15 LGC Data Cards, which I had simply
                posted as a folder of JPGs all this time ... <i>very</i>
                tough to page through or download with a browser!&nbsp;
                So last week, I had silently replaced the folder of JPGs
                with <a href="Documents/LmQuickReferenceApollo15.pdf">a
                  PDF</a>.&nbsp; (Perhaps even more irritating, Fabrizio
                had apparently originally sent me higher-resolution
                images than I actually posted, so it would have been
                nice to make the PDF from those higher-resolution
                images.&nbsp; If only I could find them, 16 years
                later!)</li>
              <li>Nearly 3 years ago, James Berry let me scan his AC
                Electronics Apollo 11 manual.&nbsp; But I was crushed
                for time, and couldn't spend the time processing the
                imagery that I should have, so I ended up posting a
                crummy PDF back then.&nbsp; Today, I've done the extra
                work, and have replaced that crummy PDF with a
                less-incompetent one.&nbsp; (Of course, if I were
                scanning it today, the raw scanned imagery itself would
                have been much better as well.&nbsp; In the end, you
                can't win!)<br>

              scans (by Mike Stewart) of Don Eyles's seemingly-endless
              collection.&nbsp; It is the final item, however, which
              stands out for me in this batch. By the way, many thanks
              to <a href="https://www.echoes-from-apollo.com/">the
                Echoes from Apollo website</a> for sending me the
              images, not without suffering a bit of inconvenience in
              doing so, I imagine! The G&amp;N Dictionary documents, in
              case you haven't looked at them before — we currently had
              only the ones for Apollo 11, 12, 13, and 17 missions — are
              a kind of quick-reference for the crew for everything
              G&amp;N related, and as such, most of the information in
              them is pretty reasonably accessible anyway ... <i>if</i>
              you happen to have the AGC source code or other
              significant documentation for the mission.&nbsp; But not <i>everything</i>
              in the G&amp;N Dictionary is so readily accessible for
              us.&nbsp; In fact, some of the information in it is unique
              at the present time.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, because it
              covers not only AGC use, but also Abort Guidance System
              (AGS) usage, including not only basic procedures for using
              the AGS software for various tasks; it contains lists of
              some octal addresses of variables in the AGS software as
              well.&nbsp; And while we have the AGS software used for
              some Apollo missions — namely, Apollo 11, 12, 15, 16, and
              17 — we do <i>not</i> have the AGS software for Apollo 5,
              9, 10, 13, or 14.&nbsp; Consequently, at least some of the
              the information summarized in the Apollo 9 Flight Crew
              G&amp;N Dictionary is the <i>only</i> information we have
              about AGS Flight Program 3 at present.&nbsp; Whether we're
              clever enough to actually use that information for
              anything remains to be seen.&nbsp; <img src="smiley.png"

            but I haven't processed them yet, and so haven't uploaded
            them; perhaps tomorrow.&nbsp; Instead, I've been looking at
            cleaning up the document library, which over the decades has
            become very inconsistent in terms of how it presents the
            documents, and well as very quirky in the way it categorizes
            them, sometimes making it difficult to find what you
            want.&nbsp; Well, nothing's perfect, so I can't make it work
            perfectly for everybody, but at least I can improve it
            somewhat.&nbsp; To me, the poster child of awfulness is
            the&nbsp;<img src="new.png" alt="" height="16" width="36">
            icon, which is not only usually out of date, but (as seen
            with all the recent additions to the library) not even very
            helpful in figuring out what's new.&nbsp; A better approach
            to that problem, I think, instead of the icons, is to simply
            have a section of the document-library page that lists (in
            reverse chronological order) the last few months of
            additions.&nbsp; <a
              href="DocumentLibraryDatabase/Recent.html">Here's a sample

            because at them moment it's only aware of about a third of
            the documents in the library, so lots of new ones are
            missing from the sample!&nbsp; Besides, it's just a first
            cut, so undoubtedly the formatting an other styling will
            change drastically.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when completed, it
            will not only be helpful in itself, but you can see that it
            presents documents in a very clean and regular presentation,
            and that regularity will be inherited by the Document
            Library page as a whole. <br>

                Even though we almost invariably call the AGC assembler
                program "YUL" on this site, YUL was just the <i>original</i>
                version of the assembler, and was only used for early
                AGC software like RETREAD or SOLARIUM.&nbsp; YUL was
                superseded by GAP, which was an entirely new program,
                which ran on an entirely different computer model.&nbsp;
                Most the AGC program listings we have were thus intended
                to be assembled by GAP, rather than by YUL.&nbsp; The
                GAP User's Guide is quite a treasure trove of

                document.&nbsp; SKYLARK, if you'll recall, is the AGC
                software for the Skylab and ASTP missions.&nbsp; Since
                we don't have the actual AGC software listings for those
                missions, every little bit of relevant documentation is
                precious.</li>
              <li>And various little odds-and-ends I won't bore you with
                that are relevant to my ongoing struggle to recreate the
                COMANCHE 67 source code.&nbsp; Well, I'll bore you with
                one thing, because it illustrates the way that valuable
                info can be hidden in the most unlikely places:&nbsp;
                The GAP User's Guide I mentioned above has an Appendix
                containing a complete octal dump of one of COMANCHE 67's
                memory banks, and partial dumps of two other
                banks.&nbsp; Who woulda thunk it?<br>

            to process and remove to my outbox, so I may be falling
            behind.&nbsp; But I think the glut is drawing down
            shortly.&nbsp; One significant fact is that among the new
            documents was LUMINARY Memo #90 Rev. 1, which is a list (up
            to the time it was written, of course) of all the COLOSSUS
            Memos and the other LUMINARY Memos.&nbsp; Since our tables

            include not only the memos we have in hand but also the ones
            we know about, it actually took a fair amount of works to
            update those tables to include all of the missing memos,
            which naturally slowed me down in processing all of the
            other new documents.&nbsp; Well, that was a one-time thing,
            and fortunately it's done now.<br>

              would have been an absolute disaster for the Virtual AGC
              Project.&nbsp; If you knew the stories developers have
              told me even within the last few weeks of the material
              which had been thrown away because it was taking up too
              much room in the house ... well, you'd be

                The software revisions presented there have changed:
                Luminary 96 (new reconstruction!) has been added and
                Luminary 99 rev 2 has been dropped.&nbsp; (Of course,
                all source code has remained unchanged, and Luminary 99
                rev 1 continues to be correctly continues to be
                presented as the flown revision.)&nbsp; The presentation
                before the change was strongly influenced by some
                recollections of AGC developer Jim Kernan, who
                maintained that there was a Luminary 99 rev 2, even
                though all documentary evidence denied its existence; so
                I had presented a reconstruction of Luminary 99 rev 2
                based on Jim's story, even while asserting that it had
                never been flown.&nbsp; However, Mike Stewart has just
                found a software anomaly report (LNY-59), not only
                allowing him to reconstruct the previously-missing
                revision Luminary 96, but also to conclude (with Don
                Eyles concurring) that Jim Kernan's recollections apply
                not to Luminary 99 rev 1/2, but to Luminary 96/97
                instead.&nbsp; So as I said, Luminary 96 is now in,
                Luminary 99 rev 2 is a fantasy and is out!</li>
              <li>In our software repository, Luminary 96 is now built
                by default and 99 rev 2 is not, while the VirtualAGC GUI
                program has been updated to add Luminary 96 and remove
                Luminary 99 rev 2.&nbsp; Moreover, the AGS tips in the
                GUI have been fixed to account for the fact that Apollo
                12 is now known to use AGS Flight Program 6 rather than
                7 (see entry from 2021-08-03) ... although the GUI
                software apparently does not pick the AGS Flight Program
                version on the basis of the Apollo mission number, just
                leaving it up to the discretion of the user, so I
                suppose that's something I'll want to look at in the

                some samples of an important class of document that I
                had previously been unaware of, or perhaps for which I
                hadn't had sufficient vision to recognize their
                value.&nbsp; I'm referring to the "Flight Crew G&amp;N
                Data Dictionary" (or sometimes "LM G&amp;N Data
                Dictionary).&nbsp; These documents include
                mission-specific information such as star charts, lists
                of AGC programs, verbs, and nouns, and concise
                explanations of using those for various procedures, and
                so on.&nbsp; Of course, many of those things are
                available elsewhere in one form or another, making their
                collection into a separate document somewhat less
                exciting.&nbsp; What <i>isn't</i> available elsewhere —
                so far as I know right now — is that the Data
                Dictionaries also provide the same kind of information
                for the LM's abort guidance computer (<a
                  href="yaAGS.html">AGS</a>).&nbsp; And since the AGS
                does not use numbered programs or "nouns" and "verbs"
                the way the AGC does, all of the AGS programs and
                variables are listed specifically by numerical
                address.&nbsp; Of course, for any version of the AGS
                Flight Program for which we actually have source code,
                we already know those numerical addresses directly from
                the code.&nbsp; But for the Flight Program versions for
                which we have no program listing?&nbsp; Then the
                associated Data Dictionary is the only available source,
                I think, for this very specific AGS info.&nbsp; At the
                moment, we have the Data Dictionaries only for Apollo 11
                and 12 (AGS Flight Program 6) and Apollo 13 (AGS Flight
                Program 7).&nbsp; And among those, we already had the
                source code for Flight Programs 6 anyway.&nbsp; But we
                have no source code for Flight Program 7, nor any
                obvious prospect for acquiring one; hence making the
                Apollo 13 Data Dictionary of unique value for insight
                into AGS Flight Program 7.&nbsp; As far as other
                versions of the Data Dictionary are concerned, of
                particular interest in regard to AGC would be the
                versions for Apollo 10 (AGS Flight Program 5), <a

                from other Data Dictionary versions on the internet, but

                even any response to inquiries on the subject.&nbsp;
                Unfortunately, this seems to be the kind of document
                which tends to be auctioned off, thus permanently
                disappearing from public view, or even in some cases
                being split apart in order to use the star charts

                WebAssembly port.</li>
              <li>Nik Beug has recently been working toward the goal —
                not complete yet! — of integrating the Virtual AGC Block
                1 CPU emulator (<a

                into the NASSP add-on for the Orbiter spaceflight
                simulator.&nbsp; The eventual goal, of course, is to be
                able to fly the Apollo 4 and Apollo 6 unmanned missions
                in NASSP/Orbiter, though since these were unmanned
                missions they naturally don't require a crew, and will
                probably be most interesting to people — particularly
                unqualified ones such as myself — as video captures of
                the simulated mission.&nbsp; Naturally, Nik has been
                uncovering problems that I had been too daft to notice
                when I wrote the Block 1 emulator.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Mike
                Stewart has been trying to run <a

                  SOLARIUM program's self-check</a> in yaAGCb1, which I
                had also neglected to do myself!&nbsp; And he has <i>also</i>
                uncovered problems with yaAGCb1 while trying to do
                so.&nbsp; Recall that SOLARIUM 55 is the Block 1 AGC
                software that was actually used in Apollo 6, and
                probably in Apollo 4 as well.&nbsp; Fortunately for us,
                or at least for <i>me</i>, Mike has been industriously
                fixing the yaAGCb1 problems he has found, which has also
                fixed the problems Nik has encountered in NASSP.&nbsp;
                So far!&nbsp; To reiterate, this does not mean that all
                problems in yaAGCb1 have been fixed yet, nor that the
                Block 1 AGC emulation in NASSP is ready to go.&nbsp; But
                it does represent substantial progress, and does mean
                that anyone who's interested in the Block 1 AGC emulator
                would be well-advised to download the latest version of
                it rather than continue using the one that has been in
                the software repository for the last 3-4 years.&nbsp;
                (By the way, you may recall that there are actually two
                Block 1 emulators in our repository:&nbsp; my yaAGCb1
                program and <a

                yaAGCb1 have not been migrated to yaAGC-Block1, but it
                is unlikely that John's program would have suffered from

            haven't yet uncovered any convenient table in the
            contemporary documentation that just lists all of the
            installed AGS software versions.&nbsp; Recall that there are
            8 known versions of this abort-system "flight software", of
            which we have copies of only 2 (namely, Flight Program 6 and
            8).&nbsp; Well, Cooper Lushbaugh (thanks, Cooper!) has taken
            it upon himself to dig more deeply into the various
            abort-system documents than I had done, and to come up with
            some of those missing answers.&nbsp; The bad news is that
            Apollo 14 turns out to have used Flight Program 7, of which
            we don't have a copy.&nbsp; And Apollo 13 <i>may</i> have
            used Flight Program 7 too.&nbsp; (But it's still possible
            that Apollo 13 may have used Flight Program 6; even Cooper's
            extra digging hasn't told us for sure.)&nbsp; As far as
            Apollo 11-12 and 15-17 are concerned, though, we seem to
            remain on solid ground that they used Flight Programs 6 and
            8, respectively.<br>

                Great job, Andy!&nbsp; The only code not affected by
                Andy's audit is the Comanche 67 reconstruction I've been
                intermittently working on, and of course that's not
                because it doesn't have misspellings — which I'll have
                to take care of later — but because I've never merged it
                into the main branch of the repository.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As you may infer from earlier entries in this change log,
              Andy employed a smart method for this audit, rather than
              relying on the brute-force approach of simply eyeballing
              all of the original source listings.&nbsp; His method
              instead involved comparing the symbol tables found at the
              end of each of the original listings against the symbol
              tables output by a modern assembly of the source
              files.&nbsp; He used an AGC assembler he had created
              himself, which listed the symbols in the same order as the
              original assembler did, and formatted the printouts the
              same way as the original assembler did, thus making a
              comparisons easy.&nbsp; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Which is not to say that he compared every entry of every
              symbol table.&nbsp; No, he merely compared the first row
              of each column on each page of the symbol table, which is
              adequate to catch the vast majority of problems.&nbsp; But
              not all!&nbsp; So it's still <i>possible</i> that a much
              smaller number of misspellings continue to lurk,
              undetected.&nbsp; Admittedly, I kind of doubt it.&nbsp; If
              anyone wants to volunteering for the mind-bending task of
              checking the symbol tables more closely, I'm sure it would
              be appreciated.<br>
            </p>
            <p>When Andy started this audit, Virtual AGC's assembler
              (yaYUL) neither sorted the AGC symbols in precisely the
              same collating sequence as the original assemblers (YUL,
              GAP) and Andy's assembler, nor formatted/paginated the
              symbol tables similarly.&nbsp; Andy has woken me up to the
              value of this, and as you may recall from a change-log
              entry a month or two ago, yaYUL now sorts, formats, and
              paginates symbol tables in a way that facilitates such
              comparisons.&nbsp; That's one of the changes incorporated
              as of today in the colorized, syntax-highlighted AGC
              listings on this site.<br>

            setups most people wouldn't normally have in place on their

          <td valign="top">I decided to follow up on yesterday's
            improvements to the modern assembler's (yaYUL) sorting of
            symbol tables.&nbsp; I've revised the format of the symbol
            tables so that they end up being much easier to compare them
            side-by-side with the original symbol tables created by the
            YUL/GAP assemblers.&nbsp; The reason one would want to do
            that, it has been pointed out to me, is that comparison of
            properly-sorted symbol tables makes it much easier to detect
            and correct misprints of symbol names in the transcribed AGC
            source code.&nbsp; For example, the difference between
            symbols like <tt>POO</tt> (pee oh oh) and <tt>P00</tt>
            (pee zero zero) may not be very apparent visually a
            digitized printout, and won't affect the assembled ropes if
            misspelled consistently in any given version of an AGC
            program, but will be very obvious in a properly-sorted
            symbol table since a misspelled symbol will appear at a
            completely different place in the table.&nbsp; Plus, it's
            just kind of nice when the output from yaYUL is a <i>little</i>
            more consistent with YUL and GAP.<br>
            <br>
            The source code for yaYUL now in the github repository has
            these changes to the symbol-table formatting in it.<br>
            <br>
            Besides that, an effort to find misspelled symbols in the
            transcribed AGC source code is actually underway right now,
            using just the methods I mentioned.&nbsp; I'm not doing this
            personally, as it preceded the symbol-table changes in
            yaYUL.&nbsp; (Various folks have amused themselves over the
            course of time by creating AGC assemblers of their own,
            rather than using yaYUL, and some of them were cleverer than
            I in formatting the symbol tables.&nbsp; <img
              src="smiley.png" alt="" height="16" width="16">)&nbsp; At
            any rate, I don't see much reason to update the colorized,
            syntax-highlighted AGC source code on this site until at
            least a first pass on searching-and-destroying those
            misspelled symbols has been completed, and thus I haven't
            done so as of yet.&nbsp; Hopefully that will be in the
            not-too-distant future.&nbsp; Anyone who's particularly
            interested can follow the effort by <a

                  assembler (yaYUL) in the github repository</a> can now
                produce symbol tables of assembled AGC code using the
                collation order of the original Apollo-era
                assemblers.&nbsp; Up to now, it has simply been using
                the native collation (presumably ASCII) of the platform
                on which yaYUL is being run.&nbsp; Symbol-table files
                (*.symtab) that yaYUL creates for use with a debugger
                remain in the native order, since otherwise the debugger
                might not be able to interpret them properly.&nbsp; The
                original YUL assembler, however, used the native
                character encoding of the Honeywell H-800 computer
                system on which it ran, and the printed symbol tables in
                the assembly listings it created were in that collating
                order.&nbsp; Likewise, the original GAP assembler which
                succeeded YUL used the native IBM character encoding,
                namely EBCDIC, for sorting symbol tables.&nbsp; Thus,
                while the assembly listings created by yaYUL had all the
                same symbols as those created by YUL or GAP, the symbols
                were in a different order, and the symbol tables were
                consequently difficult to compare.&nbsp; In general,
                after today's update, all versions of the RETREAD,
                AURORA, SUNBURST, TRIVIUM, and SOLARIUM programs were
                originally assembled with YUL and now use yaYUL's H-800
                ordering, while all other versions of AGC programs that
                are available to us were originally assembled with GAP
                and now use the EBCDIC ordering.&nbsp; Admittedly, I
                haven't checked the new assembly listings vs the
                original scans in <i>full detail</i>, since the
                combined symbol tables of all the AGC versions we now
                have available undoubtedly total more than 100,000
                symbols.&nbsp; Yikes!&nbsp; Nevertheless, even if there
                are some errors, I'm sure yaYUL's symbol-table ordering
                is very close to being correct.&nbsp; The colorized HTML
                versions of the AGC source code here at the Virtual AGC
                website don't yet reflect the H-800/EBCDIC ordering,
                because some corrections to the AGC code base are in the
                works and I'd like to avoid unnecessary churn.&nbsp;
                Once the HTML listings are updated, however, their
                symbol table ordering will hopefully match those of the
                scanned original assembly listings.<br>

            Comanche 45 was the first of the source-code reconstructions
            in which I personally participated, in a minor way, as
            opposed to simply providing commentary after the fact.&nbsp;
            It's a pretty amazing process, in which I have a lot of
            confidence.&nbsp; I doubt I'm adequately articulate to
            convey to you just how amazing it is, so I'll just leave it
            by saying that I wish all of you had the chance to
            participate and see for yourself.&nbsp; It's quite a
            learning experience ... and a bit humbling as well.<br>

                for that, it was too close to the black text in the
                reconstruction-justification annotations I've been
                adding to programs like Comanche 44 and 55.&nbsp; I.e.,
                in the colorized HTML, once you visited a link in an

                indistinguishable from the surrounding text in the
                annotation.&nbsp; So I've now changed yaYUL (which
                generates the HTML) to use default visited-link coloring
                instead, and I've regenerated all of the colorized AGC

            This is an example of what we've been calling a "Norton
            document".&nbsp; It provides, among other things, a
            pseudocode form of the AGC software.<br>
            <br>
            Aside from its intrinsic interest due to its relevance to
            Apollo 11, this document was critical to the just-completed
            reconstruction of Comanche 44 and is critical to the
            reconstruction-in-progress of Comanche 45, because the
            pseudocode description shows change bars for the differences
            between Comanche 45/2 and Comanche 55.&nbsp; While this
            doesn't tell you <i>exactly</i> what the changes were in
            AGC assembly language or interpretive code from Apollo 10 to
            Apollo 11, the pseudocode <i>often</i> follows the
            assembly/interpretive code closely enough to <i>infer</i>
            those changes.&nbsp; Or at least, it lets you infer them if
            you've developed the level of expertise and determination
            that Mike and Nik have.&nbsp;<img src="smiley.png" alt=""
              height="16" width="16">&nbsp; For the rest of us, such as
            myself, it at least lets you follow their reasoning.<br>
            <br>
            I am in the process of trying to add annotations for each of
            Mike's changes to his reconstructed Comanche 44 source code
            (relative to Comanche 51), so that a satisfying
            justification is available for each difference.&nbsp; Since
            most of those justifications are based on the Norton
            document, I'm very pleased that it can now be made
            available.&nbsp; I figure that anything which can inspire a
            higher degree of confidence in the reconstruction is a good
            thing!&nbsp; But it's slow-going to add these annotations,
            and I don't promise the annotations will be completed on any
            particular timetable.<br>

            <br>
            What I didn't know, or had stupidly overlooked (as the case
            may be), was that Comanche 44 has a bug that prevents it
            from being used with the official Apollo 10 flight
            procedures as-is.&nbsp; So a test flight of Comanche 44 is
            probably <i>not</i> imminent, and we'll probably have to
            wait until Colossus 45 is available.&nbsp; It is still
            possible to fly a Comanche 44 mission, however, because a
            workaround was published contemporaneously.&nbsp; If you're

            <br>
            As you may recall, our repositories contain a rather
            complete set of Lunar Module AGC source code, in the sense
            that almost all of the actually-flown missions are
            covered.&nbsp; Our coverage of the Command Module AGC source
            code is a bit spottier.&nbsp; The Apollo 10 mission is one
            of those gaps in which we haven't so far had the Command
            Module software.&nbsp; The software version actually flown
            on Apollo 10 was Comanche 45/2, though two prior software
            releases (Comanche 44 and 45) had been earlier targeted for
            the mission before being obsoleted, and their core-rope
            modules had already been manufactured.&nbsp; We do not have
            actual contemporary assembly listings for any of these 3
            versions.&nbsp; (A listing for Comanche 44 is known to
            exist, but we have no access to it, and sadly, it is
            becoming increasingly unlikely that we ever will.) <br>
            <br>
            You may also recall that Mike Stewart has been methodically
            trying to fill in many of these gaps in our software
            collection by reconstructing them from software versions we
            <i>do</i> have, along with contemporary documentation of
            version-to-version changes, while exploiting the fact that
            we have lists of memory-bank checksums of most of the
            manufactured core-rope modules.&nbsp; In so far as Apollo 10
            is concerned, Mike's strategy has been to <br>
            <ol>
              <li>Reconstruct Comanche 51 (unavailable, unflown Apollo
                11 code) from Comanche 55 (available, flown Apollo 11
                code).</li>
              <li>Reconstruct Comanche 44 from Comanche 51 and Colossus
                249 (available, flown Apollo 9 code).</li>
              <li>Reconstruct Comanche 45 from Comanche 44.</li>
              <li>Reconstruct Comanche 45/2 from Comanche 45.<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            The first step had been completed some time ago.&nbsp; Mike
            has now finished the second step, his reconstruction of
            Comanche 44 source code.&nbsp; Admittedly, there's a
            slightly-dubious issue with it that may need to be revisited
            later if additional contemporary Colossus
            change-documentation becomes available some time, or — gosh!
            — even the actual program listing.&nbsp; But meanwhile, in
            lieu of that, the reconstruction is darn good!&nbsp; The
            dubious issue I mentioned should not adversely affect
            execution of the code.&nbsp; The reconstructed code has all
            of the correct memory-bank checksums for Colossus 44; it's
            now available in our <a

            AGC project from source.&nbsp; You can also see the

            support in the VirtualAGC GUI program for it, though I'll
            get around to doing so soon.&nbsp; Nor has it been flown yet

            (NARA) branch at which I was scanning LM engineering
            drawings prior to closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic
            is still closed to volunteers and researchers, and indeed
            even the archivists are apparently once again having to work
            remotely (after a brief respite in which they were able to
            work onsite).&nbsp; Indeed, I've been informed that this
            situation is likely to persist into 2021 ... no surprise,
            given the sharp rise in infection rates in the U.S. and in
            Tarrant County, Texas, the location of the branch.&nbsp; So
            who knows when the LM-drawing scanning, or the CSM-drawing
            scanning (which the archive was doing on its own without my
            participation), will resume?<br>
            <br>
            In the meantime, though, Mike Stewart has somehow gotten his
            hands on a book of Block I CSM drawings, and has scanned a

              electro-mechanical page</a>.&nbsp; Of course the NARA
            microfilm collection has tens of thousands of these CSM
            drawings rather than merely dozens.&nbsp; <i>Eventually</i>
            NARA's CSM scans will be publicly available.&nbsp; At least
            that's the plan, I'm told.&nbsp; But we don't know when that
            will be — many years, I project — nor whether we'll be able
            to afford to acquire many of the scans when they do become
            available.&nbsp; (The LM scans are free to us under
            arrangement, but I wasn't able to make any such special

            I got a request yesterday from a correspondent for HP-65
            calculator software.&nbsp; As you may or may not know — I
            didn't! — an HP-65 calculator was carried on the very last
            Apollo mission, the Apollo-Soyuz Test Mission (ASTP), as a
            backup device.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, we don't have this
            software.&nbsp; Indeed, our collection of ASTP material in
            general is very small.&nbsp; But this request did prompt me
            to google a bit, in order to find what other ASTP info is
            available online.&nbsp; In the process, I mined a couple of
            documents for our document library, namely the ASTP "CSM
            Rendezvous Book" (in two parts) and "Design Characteristics
            for Soyuz and Apollo" (in three parts).&nbsp; You'll find
            them in the <a href="links.html#ASTP">ASTP-specific mission
              documents in the library</a>.&nbsp; The former document
            contains a lot of timeline data about the information which
            is supposed to be collected for entry into the HP-65.&nbsp;
            Also in the process, I found that on our Colossus page I had
            linked the wrong CSM mass-properties document in the entry
            for ASTP; now corrected.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            We've also gotten a copy of the "HP-65 Rendezvous Targeting

            for the Apollo 9 LM, which we call Sundance306ish (see the
            preceding log entry) has now been test flown in
            Orbiter/NASSP, thanks to Nik Beug.&nbsp; Given that the main
            purpose of the Apollo 9 mission is test flight of the LM,
            Nik points out that the LM AGC software gets quite a workout
            as well.&nbsp; So I think we can now be pretty confident
            that Sundance306ish works properly, even though only memory
            banks 36-43 are known to match Sundance 306 octal word for
            octal word.&nbsp; The VirtualAGC UI program now uses
            Sundance306ish for the Apollo 9 LM configuration, in place
            of the prior phase 1 reconstruction (SundanceXXX).&nbsp;
            SundanceXXX can still be flown via the command line, of
            cource, but not from the UI.<br>

          <td valign="top">Recall from a couple of weeks ago that the LM
            AGC software for Apollo 9, namely <a
              href="Luminary.html#Sundance306">Sundance 306</a>, was in
            the process of being <i>reconstructed</i> from
            memory-module dumps in lieu of an actual assembly listing of
            the Sundance 306 program.&nbsp; Reconstruction is a 3-phase
            process, in which phases 1 and 2 are successively-close
            approximations to the exact code, but only phase 3 will be
            an exact reconstruction.&nbsp; As you'll recall, phase 1
            (which we call SundanceXXX), which is supposed to
            functionally match Sundance 306 but not match it octal word
            for octal word, had been completed and successfully test
            flown.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Well, phase 2 (Sundance306ish), which is supposed to improve
            on phase 1 (SundanceXXX) by matching the contents of
            Sundance 306 memory banks 36-43 octal word for octal word,
            has now been completed as well.&nbsp; It has not yet been
            validated by being test flown, though I expect it will be
            flown (successfully) in the near future.&nbsp; I won't add
            support for it to the Virtual AGC GUI program until after a
            test flight, but you can still look at the code or run it in
            the AGC simulation via a command line right now.&nbsp; You

            It's admittedly unlikely we'll ever have a full phase 3
            reconstruction, in which <i>all</i> memory-bank contents or
            even all memory-bank checksums are correct, no matter how
            much cleverness Mike and Nik manage to apply to the
            problem.&nbsp; I think we'd need extra source material which
            we don't currently have, such as an actual list of all of
            the Sundance 306 memory-bank checksums.&nbsp; Of course, one
            can't rule getting such a list, nor even the possibility of
            getting our hands on an actual assembly listing one day ...
            in which case the reconstruction would remain a magnificent
            <i>tour de force</i>, but ultimately have been
            obsoleted.&nbsp; Still, barring that, it's likely that
            incremental improvements to Sundance306ish are what's in
            store for the future regarding the Apollo 9 LM
            software.&nbsp; I'd recommend enjoying it as it is, rather
            than pining to no avail for source material we may never get
            our hands on.&nbsp; Gather ye rosebuds and <i>carpe</i>

            I.e., the numerical constants that had to be entered into
            the AGC manually or via telemetry upload, rather than being
            hard-coded into the AGC's software.&nbsp; This is pretty
            timely, considering that the initial reconstruction of the
            Apollo 9 software just became available a few days
            ago.&nbsp; The pad loads, you see, list both the memory
            addresses and variable names into which the pad-loaded
            numerical data goes, and thus gives us a way to associate <i>some</i>
            of the variable names in erasable memory with their physical
            addresses, independent of the software source code.&nbsp;
            I'm told that the addresses in the Apollo 9 pad loads do
            indeed match the addresses Mike and Nik used in the
            reconstructed software, though it turns out that one
            variable was triple precision but had been treated only as
            double precision in the reconstruction.&nbsp; So the pad
            loads provide not only a nice, independent confirmation of
            the accuracy of the reconstruction, but also have managed to
            pinpoint a minor error that had to be fixed!&nbsp; <img

          <td valign="top">Although most of the recent updates to this
            change log have related to the LVDC, it's well to keep in
            mind that the main focus of this program is to provide the
            original AGC software, along with means to emulate the AGC,
            and and thus to run the original AGC software on your own
            (presumably non-AGC) computer.&nbsp; And best of all, in
            some ways, to run that software in the context of a
            simulated Apollo mission on a spaceflight simulator such as
            Orbiter/NASSP.&nbsp; If you want to fly a complete Apollo
            mission, you ideally want to have the <i>complete</i> AGC
            software for that mission: i.e., both the CM software and
            the LM software.&nbsp; The Holy Grail, of course, would be
            to have complete sets of AGC software for <i>every</i>
            Apollo mission.&nbsp; We haven't quite succeeded in reaching
            that pinnacle, but I think the results (after 17 years!) are
            still reasonably impressive.&nbsp; Much more than I could
            ever imagine 17 years ago.&nbsp; Ignoring those missions for
            which we have partial sets, in which we have the LM software
            but not the CM software or vice-versa, we have complete
            software sets (more or less) for the following missions:<br>

              <li>Apollo 5</li>

            <p>The presence of <font color="#ff0000">Apollo 9</font> on
              that list is new, as of today ... though not without a bit
              of hand-waving and qualification!&nbsp; I was actually
              sent notice of the software's availability a few days ago,
              in time to write it up for the 51st anniversary of the
              Apollo 11 landing.&nbsp; Alas, after last year's general
              excitement about the 50th anniversary, I didn't even
              realize the 51st was imminent, so I let the opportunity
              slip by.&nbsp; As it happens, almost nobody else in the
              world apparently remembered this particular birthday,
              either, so even though I may be an insensitive clod, I
              guess I'm not the only one at fault.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Hand-waving or not, it's an interesting tale.&nbsp;
              Long-time followers of this project may recall that the
              Apollo 9 CM software (Colossus 249) was the 2nd AGC
              software version to which we got access, and was the very
              1st CM software version we got.&nbsp; But the principal
              objective of the Apollo 9 mission was the first test of
              the LM, in Earth orbit.&nbsp; Since the LM software
              (Sundance 306) never seemed to be forthcoming, the fact
              that we had only the CM software for Apollo 9 never seemed
              tremendously exciting.&nbsp; <br>
            </p>
            <p>Many years passed without much change in this situation,
              though <i>eventually</i>, interesting things.&nbsp; The
              first stirrings, surprisingly, were in the realm of AGC
              hardware rather than software:<br>
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>We managed to acquire complete electrical schematics
                for the AGC, in many different revisions.&nbsp; <br>
              </li>
              <li>An (mostly-unaffiliated) project to restore a physical
                AGC to working order for the 50th anniversary of the
                Apollo 11 landing succeeded, ending up with a working
                AGC.&nbsp; </li>
              <li>The now-working AGC was used, among other things, to <i>dump</i>
                the contents of memory modules from various museums and
                personal collections.&nbsp; (And there are still more
                modules to be dumped eventually, I'm told.)&nbsp; We
                benefited from that effort by getting dumps of the
                core-ropes from each of the 6 Sundance memory modules
                ... but <i>not</i> all from the same revision of
                Sundance.&nbsp; Thus, instead of dumps of Sundance 306's
                memory modules, we had some dumps from Sundance 292,
                some from Sundance 302, some from Sundance 306.&nbsp;
                And not all mutually-compatible with each other.</li>
              <li>As of today, we have something much more exciting in a
                software sense: a decompilation of those memory modules,
                along with a reconciliation of their incompatibilities —
                almost entirely shifts of the addresses fo variables and
                code between different revisions.&nbsp; The result is
                that we now have a complete, functioning Sundance
                program.&nbsp; This program is still not Sundance
                306:&nbsp; rather, it is a mogrelization of Sundance
                292, 302, and 306.&nbsp; We call it <b>SundanceXXX</b>.&nbsp;


























































































































































































































































































                Mongrelized or not, SundanceXXX does function, properly
                according to Apollo 9 documentation, and can be used
                successfully to fly Apollo 9 missions in Orbiter/NASSP,
                as well as in our native VirtualAGC UI.<br>

              memory modules.<br>

            <p>The next step in the process is to modify SundanceXXX in
              such a way as to fully restore Sundance 306 itself.&nbsp;
              Whether this proves possible remains to be seen, and we'll
              just have to keep our fingers crossed.&nbsp; But in the
              meantime, as I said, SundanceXXX is flyable.&nbsp; If
              you're willing to accept it in that vein, we now have a
              complete set of Apollo 9 software, albeit one whose
              authenticity at the binary level may (hopefully!) be
              improved later.<br>

            updating this change log.&nbsp; The PTC/LVDC emulator is
            actually working quite well now, but I'm immersed in
            nitpicking details that are of no importance in the larger
            scheme of things before I can close it out.&nbsp; For
            example, the PTC front panel has a printer that the PTC CPU
            can print to, and in order to get the PTC software's self
            tests to pass, I not only have to have the emulated printer
            print the proper stuff (easy!) but also to have the emulated
            printer emulate the (undocumented) timing of the original
            physical printer (hard!).&nbsp; Yes, it's silly, and
            certainly of no value in terms of LVDC emulation, but the
            problem is that the PTC software doesn't advance past tests
            that fail, so if I want to make sure all the self tests I <i>care</i>
            about are actually run, I need to make sure the silly tests
            I <i>don't</i> care about pass as well.&nbsp; Or I can just
            cheat and comment out the tests I don't like in the original
            PTC self-test software; I've had to do that a couple of
            times already, but I'd really prefer not to do that until
            forced to do so.&nbsp; The tests that I "care" about, of
            course, are those that exercise the CPU's instructions and
            interrupts, and if we can get those right for the PTC CPU,
            then there's a good chance that they're right for the
            only-slightly-different LVDC.&nbsp; PTC emulation good →
            LVDC emulation good.<br>

            Johannes Kemppanen for bringing this to my attention!)&nbsp;
            These handbooks consist of 3 sections, two of which
            (Sections II and III) appear in the collection.&nbsp; The
            missing Section I would seem to contain the spacecraft's
            electrical schematics and (presumably) a textual description
            of the theory thereof.&nbsp; What's particularly significant
            insofar as the OBC (Gemini flight computer) is concerned,
            though, is that ~50 pages of Section II, namely section
            2.5.7, comprise a detailed user manual for the flight
            software.&nbsp; While we already had section 2.5.7 (and not
            much else) for Gemini 7, the Gemini 10 version is larger and
            more detailed.&nbsp; And of course, has mission-dependent
            differences.&nbsp; At any rate, you can explore the Gemini
            10 operations handbook in <a
              href="links.html#Gemini_spacecraft_computer">our document
              library</a>, or explore what we know about the Gemini
            flight computer on <a href="Gemini.html">our Gemini page</a>,
            if you have not already done so.&nbsp; Gemini flight
            computer, as you may recall, is a variant of the LVDC used
            to guide the Saturn rocket, and now that our PTC/LVDC
            emulation is nearing fruition, our Gemini page and software
            is probably due for an overhaul to incorporate what has been
            discovered along the way.&nbsp; But I'll leave that for
            another day.<br>
            <br>
            A couple of other items from the Collins collection caught
            my eye, and so have been added to the document library as
            well:&nbsp; A partial copy of the <i>Final Gemini X Flight

              Gemini VIII Flight Plan</i>, but different parts parts of
            that document are missing, so the two end up somewhat
            complementing each other.&nbsp; Also, an MSC noted titled "<a

            couldn't answer) about the Saturn Flight Control Computer,
            which was an analog computer in the Saturn Instrumentation
            Unit that worked in conjunction with the LVDC and LVDA — and
            the AGC — I realized that there was some confusion
            online.&nbsp; On the LVDC page, I had correctly depicted the
            device with a picture of the Saturn V Flight Control
            Computer, but online it was possible to find many pictures
            (incorrectly labeled) that were really of the Saturn I
            Flight Control Computer, and which looked very
            different.&nbsp; (One is a big cylindrical can, while the

            the descriptions I had provided about the photos of LVDC

            I've been spending all my time lately on getting the PTC
            emulation up and running, so that the PTC ADAPT Self-Test
            Program can be run in emulation.&nbsp; Specifically, I'm
            working toward getting that original Apollo-era program's
            self-test procedures to run, in emulation, in order to
            validate our LVDC CPU emulator.&nbsp; Lots and lots of
            progress has been made, but there's still a lot to do before
            it's ready to go.&nbsp; I mention all this mainly as a
            lead-in to point out that the documentation on the LVDC page
            has been undergoing a steady revision because of that

            octals for the PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program has been through
            a round of additional corrections.&nbsp; Plus, <a
              href="LVDC.html">my online redigestion of how LVDC/PTC

            with all the stuff I found out in the process.&nbsp; The
            upshot is that the LVDC assembler not assembles the PTC
            ADAPT Self-Test Program, with no errors, and the octals
            generated by the assembly match the transcribed ones
            100%.&nbsp; And the original LVDC AS206-RAM Flight Program
            still assembles 100% exactly as well, with some improvements
            to the messages generated by the assembler.<br>
            <br>
            That's a mouthful, but the upshot is that our second "LVDC"

            restrictions they our first LVDC program <i>may</i>
            be.&nbsp; Since its function is self-test, it will prove
            invaluable in validating our eventual LVDC/PTC
            emulator.&nbsp; Now all we need is an LVDC/PTC emulator, and
            we can actually run the thing.<br>

                to the tantalizing puzzle of Apollo 9's AGC
                software.&nbsp; Way back at the beginning of the Virtual
                AGC Project, the Apollo 9 CM software (COLOSSUS 249) was
                almost the first AGC software available; we actually had
                it at the same time as the Apollo 13 LM software
                (LUMINARY 131), but I happened to choose to work with
                the LM software first and the CM software second.&nbsp;
                So if LUMINARY 131 is our project's α, then COLOSSUS 249
                is its β.&nbsp; On the other hand, if the COLOSSUS
                printout had been just a little more legible, and the
                LUMINARY one a little less so, it could just as easily
                have been the other way around.&nbsp; And if that's our
                α, what's our ω?&nbsp; Or as discussions of alpha vs
                omega always seem to put it, for some unknown reason,
                our Ω?&nbsp; Well, <i>right now</i> that's the <a

                  (SUNDANCE 306)</a>.&nbsp; The "tantalizing mystery"
                about it is that we don't have the source code for it,
                though we do have the complete assembled, executable
                form of it; not <i>entirely</i> in the correct
                revision, mind you, but rather as a mixture of chunks
                from SUNDANCE 292, 302, and 306.&nbsp; The puzzles are
                how to recover a fully 306 executable from those bits
                and pieces, and how subsequently to recover the source
                code?&nbsp; Nobody knows ... yet!&nbsp; Once we do,
                though, it will be great since we'll unambiguously have

                moment.&nbsp; In retrospect, I can see that these
                change-notes on the topic have been rather piecemeal, so
                that someone who's following the topic merely from these
                notes, rather than from <a
                  href="LVDC.html#PTC_ADAPT_Self-Test_Program">the LVDC
                  page's discussion</a>, probably finds it confusing or
                uninteresting, or both.&nbsp; Here's an executive
                summary that perhaps makes it a little clearer:&nbsp;
                The only Launch Vehicle Digital Computer (LVDC) software
                we've had until recently is a program called the
                AS206-RAM Flight Program which, while amazing in many
                ways, <i>may</i> be restricted in distribution by a
                U.S. regulation known as ITAR.&nbsp; Thus, out of
                caution, I haven't so far been able to post it
                online.&nbsp; But a couple of weeks ago, we found <i>another</i>
                LVDC program, definitely <i>not</i> restricted by ITAR,
                buried in some documents about the LVDC that we had
                newly posted online.&nbsp; This new program is the PTC
                ADAPT Self-Test Program, or as I call it for short, the
                PAST program.&nbsp; What this turns out to be, if you
                ignore some technical quibbles, is a program for the
                LVDC which is similar in purpose to our "validation
                suite" software for the AGC.&nbsp; I.e., it thoroughly
                tests the LVDC's instruction set and various other
                aspects of the CPU.&nbsp; Consequently, once a LVDC
                emulator has been created, running the PAST program on
                it may be the key to validating that the LVDC emulator
                actually works as intended.&nbsp; Great stuff!&nbsp; But
                still, it's just work-in-progress at the moment,
                seasoned with speculation, so I don't want to oversell
                it too much.<br>

              transcription of the "octal listing" for the PTC ADAPT
              Self-Test Program</a> has been completed and
            proofed.&nbsp; The "octal listing" is the assembled form of
            the PTC program, so in principle, if you had an LVDC
            emulator that supported the slight instruction-set
            differences between the LVDC and PTC, you could actually run
            it in simulation right now.&nbsp; Of course, you <i>don't</i>
            have such an LVDC emulator (I assume), so that's admittedly
            not terribly helpful just yet.&nbsp; (Moreover, I should
            warn you that even though the transcription has been
            completely "proofed", there's every reason to believe that
            it's unlikely to be 100% correct yet.&nbsp; I relied on OCR
            for data entry in order to save time, and OCR'ing this kind
            of material is such an inherently buggy process that during
            proofing I ended up having to correct nearly 25% of the
            octals.&nbsp; Which almost guarantees that a significant
            number of errors escaped my notice.&nbsp; My guess is that
            10-20 errors were undetected on this first proofing pass.)<br>
            <br>
            But emulation isn't really the purpose of the transcribed
            octal listing anyway.&nbsp; Its real purpose is to serve as
            an eventual cross-check of the transcribed source code for
            the PTC ADAPT Self-Test program, since when that transcribed
            source code is assembled using our modern LVDC assembler, it
            should produce an octal listing identical to the original
            (transcribed) one.&nbsp; But transcription of the source
            code has barely begun at this point, so cross-checking it is
            hardly an immediate issue!&nbsp; Personally, I'm not going
            to revisit proofing of the octal listing until after
            transcription of the source code, so the octal listing will
            remain in this proofed-but-probably-still-buggy shadow state
            for quite a while unless somebody else cares to step forward
            and take care of it.<br>
            <br>
            Incidentally, the LVDC is essentially a black box, in which
            electrical inputs are provided and electrical outputs are
            produced, but there's no user interface, so it's not clear
            that emulating it outside the context of (say) a full
            spacecraft simulator like Orbiter/NASSP would be too
            exciting for anybody.&nbsp; (Not to mention the fact that we
            <i>still</i> don't even know whether ITAR would allow us to
            "export" the LVDC Flight Program to Orbiter/NASSP
            anyway.&nbsp; But I just meant it might be not too exciting
            entertainment-wise.)&nbsp; Admittedly, the LVDC does have
            telemetry that could be monitored.&nbsp; But for the PTC, on
            the other hand, one of the peripherals it includes is a
            printer, and the PTC ADAPT Self-Test Program does send
            output to that printer.&nbsp; So, perversely, simulating
            execution of the PTC ADAPT Self-Test program could actually
            be more fun than simulating execution of an LVDC Flight
            Program, because we could watch messages appear on the
            simulated PTC's simulated printer.&nbsp; <img

              assembly drilldowns</a> is now complete.&nbsp; I.e., all
            parts lists for G&amp;N assemblies traceable in a top-down
            fashion from the top-level guidance system assemblies have
            now been entered into the repositories, checked, debugged,
            and used to regenerate all of the G&amp;N assembly drilldown
            pages (such as <a
              href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/6014999-091.html">the
              Apollo 11 LM Guidance System</a>).&nbsp; Plus, I found
            that the script which generates the drilldown's web-pages
            had rotted somehow and begun discarding some items in the
            parts list that had non-integer quantities (such as cable
            lengths).&nbsp; Hopefully, I've fixed that.&nbsp; That's not
            to say that the drilldown is "perfect" (even in the very
            loose sense that that word is now apparently being used by
            some folks in America), but it does mean that I don't have
            any ideas right now about how to track down residual errors
            in the drilldown.&nbsp; So I feel entitled to say that the
            work has been completed.<br>
            <br>
            However ... I do have some plans to improve the drilldowns
            at some point in the future, though not necessarily right
            away since I have other things I want to take care of
            first.&nbsp; Eventually, though, the idea for improvement is
            that since the existing drilldowns have been generated in a
            top-down fashion, they run into difficulties whenever
            there's some G&amp;N subassembly for which we don't have a
            drawing.&nbsp; When that happens, none of the
            sub-subassemblies or components belonging to the missing
            subassembly will appear in the assembly drilldown.&nbsp; For
            instance, if you look the page for the Apollo 11 LM Guidance
            System mentioned above, you'll see that item #72 in the
            guidance system parts list is 6011876, "Sunshade and Radar
            Shield Assembly".&nbsp; We do not have the drawing for that,
            and consequently don't know what the Sunshade and Radar
            Shield Assembly contains; it's just a drawing number and a
            title, and nothing more.&nbsp; All of the <i>other</i>
            subassemblies of the guidance system are instead expanded to
            a greater or lesser degree.<br>
            <br>
            But wait ... don't abandon hope!&nbsp; Fortunately, many of
            the G&amp;N drawings contain not only parts lists for their
            own components and subassemblies, but also list their own
            parent drawings; i.e., they provide a list of all of the
            G&amp;N assemblies in whose parts lists they themselves
            appear.&nbsp; This is rather hit-and-miss, and not all
            drawings do this.&nbsp; But enough of them do it that it's
            possible to create a kind of half-baked assembly hierarchy
            by working from the bottom-up rather than the
            top-down.&nbsp; Let's call that a "drill-up".<br>
            <br>
            If a "drill-up" assembly hierarchy were combined with the
            "drill-down" assembly hierarchy we already have, it should
            be possible to make a more-complete assembly hierarchy in
            which <i>some</i> of the missing assemblies (and their
            contents) are partially filled in.&nbsp; Alas, making the
            drill-up will require not only some preparatory thought, but
            also some software (easy!) and a huge database of the parent
            assemblies for G&amp;N drawings that list their own parents
            (very time-consuming to create!).<br>
            <br>
            In just a handful of cases, the most significant of which
            being the "logic modules" in the Block II AGC, this kind of
            thing has already been done.&nbsp; <a
              href="http://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/6014999-091.html#2003993-031">For









































































































































































































































































































              example</a>, if you trace down through the drawings for
            the Apollo 11 LM guidance system (drawing 6014999-091), down
            to the AGC itself (drawing 2003993-031), you'll find that
            the drawing for the logic modules (2003888-<i>xxx</i>) is
            missing.&nbsp; Frustratingly, the logic modules are the
            critical active portions of the AGC, since they contain all
            of the digital electronics; i.e., everything that makes the
            computer compute!&nbsp; Considering how critical they were,
            just washing our hands of it at that point and saying "too
            bad!" didn't seem to be an adequate response.&nbsp; Luckily,
            we just happened to discover some of the significant
            assemblies comprising 2003888, and thus were able to include
            them in our existing assembly drilldown.&nbsp; E.g., even
            though 2003888 is missing from the assembly drilldown, the
            drilldown still is able to list some of the elements for
            Logic Module A3 (2003888-031) as being the circuit boards
            1006395-005 and 1006395-006, and the electrical schematic
            2005251.<br>
            <br>
            However, the existing places in the assembly drilldown where
            we've been able to do this have really been more a product
            of luck and desperation than of any systematic effort to
            work around missing assemblies in general.&nbsp; The idea of
            the proposed future "drill up" is to supply such a
            systematic effort across the entire spectrum of G&amp;N
            drawings, and to work around missing assemblies wherever
            possible, rather than merely wherever lucky and
            desperate.&nbsp; <img src="smiley.png" alt="" height="16"
              width="16"><br>
            <br>
            As I say, though, this won't be done right away, and I don't
            have any particular schedule on which I'm contemplating
            doing it.&nbsp; Of course, anyone who wanted to help out in
            creating the database of parent assemblies could help to
            move it along a little faster!<br>

                  groveling to me personally and showing me your U.S.
                  citizenship documentation.&nbsp; Actually, the program
                  is not for the LVDC proper, but rather for a
                  ground-based device called the PTC, which contains a
                  "modified" LVDC CPU.&nbsp; But at this point it would
                  seem to be a reasonable hope that we can largely treat

                Actually, these reports cover a lot more than just
                weight and balance, such as electrical draw of different
                hardware modules, sizes of AGC software modules,
                etc.&nbsp; Each "revision" covers a separate month, or
                (early and late in the project) a separate several-month
                period.&nbsp; We already had a bunch of these in the
                library, but now we have a bunch more ... possibly a
                complete set of them, from 1962 through 1969.&nbsp;

                70-FM-145 (added a week or so ago) have searchable text,
                due to technical difficulties.&nbsp; I'm sure there are
                plenty of other documents in the library about which the
                same could be said, so it's not as if it's a tragedy,

            is now into a region of the aperture-card boxes in which we
            have the top-level drawing for LTA-8, and lots of
            upper-level drawings for it as well.&nbsp; It's true, I'm
            sure, that people in general aren't as interested in LTA-8
            as in a "real" LEM — "LTA" stands for Lunar Test Article
            —but one shouldn't shouldn't disrespect LTA-8!<br>

            Unfortunately, the aperture-card scanner broke down a couple
            of weeks ago, and I'm not privy at present to the proposed
            scheduling for getting it fixed.&nbsp; Actually, what with
            the intervening Holidays and various other coincidental
            conditions, I'm not even sure that the scheduling has been
            addressed yet at NARA.&nbsp; Well, it'll be fixed when it
            will be fixed, and for now we'll have what we'll have.&nbsp;
            In the interim, I'm hoping to go back and scan (with a
            different, slower scanner) the drawings which proved
            partially or completely illegible on the first
            attempt.&nbsp; That's about 400 scans.&nbsp; But again,
            we'll have to see.<br>

                I suppose this reorganization doesn't need any serious

                this file will eventually exceed 60MB in size — which
                should give you some idea why I don't think you'd want
                to load it into your browser — though right now it's in
                the neighborhood of just 2MB.&nbsp; Since the project of
                scanning the LEM drawings and indexing them is ongoing,

                well), and as such is likely to have some teething
                problems ... but whether or not that turns out to be the
                case, it's still a lot better than having no
                titles.&nbsp; A handful of drawing numbers and/or titles
                are missing or partial for a variety of reasons, such as
                the scan just being too light or the sheets containing
                the titles being in aperture-card boxes that haven't yet
                been scanned.&nbsp; So expect there will be still be
                some improvements in that area in the coming months or

          <td valign="top">With the completion of scans of the MIT
            G&amp;N System engineering drawings last week, scanning of
            GAEC (Grumman) LM engineering drawings has now
            commenced.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            I've had second thoughts about my earlier comments, wherein
            I said that I wouldn't bother to index any of the LM
            drawings, and have decided to go ahead and provide a
            dedicated index page for each box of LM drawings.&nbsp;
            Nevertheless, for technical reasons it's <i>still</i> the
            case that I don't intend to add any of these LM drawings to
            the master engineering search engine or to provide assembly
            drilldowns.&nbsp; So the drawings will still be a trifle
            trickier to access than the G&amp;N drawings in some
            cases.&nbsp; At any rate, the first couple of boxes are now
            available, namely <a href="LemDrawingIndexBox502.html">Box
              502</a> and <a href="LemDrawingIndexBox503.html">Box 503</a>.&nbsp;

























































































































































































































































































































































            We won't be reaching the drawing-number range containing the
            top-level drawings for the LM until boxes 518 through 528,
            though, which hopefully will happen sometime in January
            2020, depending on the breaks.&nbsp; Due to the fact that
            the metadata for the LM drawings is completely different in
            form from the metadata I was working with for the G&amp;N
            system, the process of creating these indices is very much a
            work in progress that will undoubtedly experience a few
            initial hiccups.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Unfortunately,</i> the drawing metadata (drawing number,
            revision code, etc.) on which the box-index pages are
            necessarily based turns out to be incorrect much more often
            than I've been accustomed to in the earlier (G&amp;N system)
            scans.&nbsp; There are dozens of such errors in boxes 502
            and 503 alone.&nbsp; The usual error is an incorrect drawing
            number.&nbsp; Thus it is often the case that due to being
            mislabeled, a drawing may not only be in the wrong position
            in the index table for any given box, but may even be in the
            wrong box entirely.&nbsp; I've made an attempt at correcting
            these, but given the vast number of scans involved, there's
            just no way I can do it whilst still performing scans of
            additional boxes.&nbsp; In other words, I had to give up
            pretty quickly.&nbsp; Perhaps they can be corrected in the
            future ... perhaps by someone much more interested in the
            LEM drawings than I personally am.&nbsp; (Hint!)&nbsp; But
            don't hold your breath waiting for me to do more than a
            handful of them myself.<br>
            <br>
            Possibly even worse, the aperture-card punch-data doesn't
            list any of the drawing titles at all, not even the
            abbreviated titles as the G&amp;N punch-card metadata
            did.&nbsp; So at present, all (or almost all) drawing titles
            are simply listed as blank.&nbsp; Over the course of time,
            perhaps, those drawing titles can be manually added to the
            index pages.&nbsp; (Again, hint!&nbsp; Hint!!)&nbsp; As a
            rule of thumb, I'd say that any entries having a non-blank
            title in the index have also been double-checked or correct
            insofar as their other metadata.<br>

            boxes 431-477 are the entirety of the Apollo G&amp;N System
            engineering drawings stored at the National Archives
            Southwest branch in Forth Worth, Texas, and thus I've now
            scanned <i>all</i> available CM/LM G&amp;N drawings.&nbsp;
            As far as we know.&nbsp; There's always the possibility of
            aperture-cards being stashed in the <i>wrong</i> boxes and
            therefore remaining undiscovered — indeed, I found a dozen
            or so such drawings today — but admittedly, it may be a very
            long time (if ever) before such misplaced drawings are
            revealed.&nbsp; In other words, I wouldn't hold my
            breath!&nbsp; At any rate, the grand total so far is about
            90K scans of about 12K unique drawing numbers.<br>
            <br>
            That doesn't mean the work on these G&amp;N drawings has
            finished.&nbsp; Many of the indices for the boxes still need
            to have their drawing titles corrected to agree with the
            drawings' title blocks (as opposed to the aperture cards'
            punched metadata), and many assemblies represented by the
            drawings still need to have their bill-of-material
            information digitized to allow accurate assembly drilldowns;
            plus, those electrical drawings being transcribed to CAD
            still need transcription.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the initial
            work of physically scanning the drawings has finished, and
            the remaining work on them can proceed without regard to
            physical access to the archives.<br>
            <br>
            It also doesn't mean that scanning is complete,
            either.&nbsp; While scanning of guidance &amp; navigation
            drawings has finished, many additional (non-G&amp;N)
            unscanned boxes of aperture cards remain.&nbsp; The next
            step is to scan Grumman's LM engineering drawings, boxes
            241-333 and 502-688.&nbsp; A quick calculation shows that
            there are 280 LM boxes (over 500K scans) vs the 47 G&amp;N
            boxes (90K scans) ... so it may take quite a while.&nbsp;
            There are additionally many hundreds of North American CSM
            boxes, but I'm not currently planning to scan any of those
            personally; I have reason to believe they may <i>eventually</i>
            become available via other mechanisms without any
            intervention be me (thank goodness!), but "eventually" is a
            rather open-ended concept in this case.<br>
            <br>
            Incidentally, box 477 contained a group of drawings (over
            500 of them) not conforming to the pattern of the other
            G&amp;N drawings. The group included such things as IRNs
            (Interface Revision Notices) and TDRRs (Technical Data
            Releases or Revisions).&nbsp; Right now, it's hard for me to
            deal with these anomalous drawings in the same kind of
            context (i.e., <a href="TipueSearch.html">master
              engineering search engine or</a> aperture-card box index
            pages) as the other drawings.&nbsp; As a result, instead of
            including them on <a href="AgcDrawingIndexBox477.html">the
              box 477 page</a>, I've segregated them onto <a
              href="ElectroMechanical.html#Additional_Engineering_Drawings">a
              separate "Additional Engineering Drawing" portal</a>, from
            which you can still view the scan without any expectation of
            them being pre-digested by me.&nbsp; Several other groups of
            anomalous drawings (from boxes 431 and 472, and elsewhere)
            have been included on that portal as well.&nbsp; I expect
            that the Grumman LM drawings whose scanning will commence
            soon will be handled in that same way, simply because it
            would be incredibly time-consuming for me to treat them
            comparably to the G&amp;N drawings.&nbsp; In other words,
            I'm willing to scan non-G&amp;N drawings, but not to fuss
            with them endlessly.&nbsp; That will be left as an exercise
            for the reader. <img src="smiley.png" alt="" height="16"

            previously-missing drawing (1020428) with mispunched
            aperture-card data that had incorrectly identified it (as
            1010428).&nbsp; Unfortunately, due to the vast number of
            scans being made, time-pressure has so far caused me to
            often <i>trust</i> the drawing numbers punched in the
            aperture cards, and to assume that only the drawing <i>titles</i>
            need to be corrected.&nbsp; In other words, since the titles
            are the same for all cards with the same drawing number, I
            haven't typically needed to look at every single scan, and
            hence haven't really had any way to detect scans with
            miscoded drawing numbers or revision codes.&nbsp; Over the
            past few days, though, I've been finding such miscodings,
            which have usually ended up in the wrong boxes (as 1020428
            did), rendering them undiscoverable afterward if the drawing
            numbers aren't corrected.&nbsp; So at some point, sadly, I'm
            going to have to revisit these scans and look at every
            single one of them to see if their drawing numbers and/or
            revision codes match the index.&nbsp; At the moment there
            are over 80K scans ... and soon to be over 100K for the
            Apollo G&amp;N system alone.&nbsp; I can't say I'm looking
            forward to that.&nbsp; Anyone to wants to volunteer to help

            error-prone nature of this activity, due to it being almost
            entirely manual, there was an additional difficulty for box
            439.&nbsp; As you may recall, the microfilm slides of the
            drawings are taped into "aperture cards", which are computer
            punch-cards into which metadata such as the drawing number,
            revision code, etc., has been punched.&nbsp; Well, it looks
            for all the world as if (back when the aperture cards were
            created, whenever <i>that</i> may have been) whoever was
            doing it may have dropped a hundred or so of the microfilm
            frames on the floor prior to taping them into the cards, and
            then picked them up and taped them into the cards <i>without</i>
            checking that the slides were still in the correct
            order.&nbsp; So for this range of 100 or so scans, the
            metadata usually does not match the drawings.&nbsp; The
            drawing numbers are often right (but not always) on the
            messed-up cards, but the revision codes were usually
            wrong.&nbsp; Yikes!&nbsp; (Or Yipe! if you prefer.)&nbsp;

            entire <a href="AgcDrawingIndexBox471.html">box 471</a>,
            and about 5% of <a href="AgcDrawingIndexBox472.html">box
              472</a>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in the case of the latter
            two boxes, the scanner began degrading very rapidly toward
            the end of the process ... i.e., the scanner requires
            cleaning.&nbsp; When that happens, it tends to mean that the
            metadata scanned from the cards is often incorrect, which is
            precisely what happened in this case.&nbsp; That metadata
            (drawing number, revision, sheet number, frame number, etc.)
            is used to form the index tables for their respective&nbsp;
            web-pages, so errors in the metadata result in a corrupted
            index.&nbsp; I've corrected many hundreds of entries in the
            indices for boxes 471 and 472 so far, but there's no
            guarantee I've caught all of the errors.&nbsp; Hopefully, if
            there are errors remaining in the index, they'll be caught
            and corrected in the reasonably near future.&nbsp; For now
            (alas!) I'm going to curtail scanning activities until the
            scanner has been cleaned, because finding/correcting the
            drawing index is quite a laborious process.&nbsp; Hopefully
            I'll be able to resume scanning again around the middle of
            next week.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            My short-term goal is to finish scanning all of the Apollo
            G&amp;N boxes (i.e., through box 477) by November 21, which
            is the last day the U.S. government (and hence the National
            Archives) is funded.&nbsp; In other words, if the government
            shuts down on the 21st, then scanning will be impossible for
            the duration of the shutdown.&nbsp; Personally, I think a
            shutdown is highly likely.&nbsp; News reports, on the other
            hand, are so far discounting that possibility.&nbsp; Well,
            we'll see; I'd be happy to be wrong.&nbsp; At any rate,
            after box 477 is scanned, then scanning of the (hopefully!)
            complete set of Grumman Lunar Module aperture cards will
            commence.&nbsp; I expect that process to take the next
            couple of years.<br>

            by simply adding a link to their raw scans at our Internet

            them in indexed form at all.&nbsp; Too bad, but better than

            documents which we had thought were incomplete were actually
            complete after all.&nbsp; So it's entirely possible that

            steps up and does some checking.&nbsp; Well, that's life, I

                Box 431 is particularly notable because it contains a

                also physically contains a few dozen Interface Control

                follow a different numbering convention than all of the
                MIT/AC/Ratheon/etc. aperture cards scanned so far, I
                have not yet worked out how they should be processed or
                presented, so I've not yet made them available online
                ... which is the reason that Box 431 is listed as being
                only "partial".&nbsp; Besides that, because of the bulk
                of scans that <i>have</i> been added (~9000 microfilm
                slides), I've not had the opportunity to fix up the

                the titles just show up in the index in the 21-character
                abbreviated forms punched into the aperture cards.&nbsp;
                I'll fix them up some time, but it's an ongoing process

                I'll list them all here.&nbsp; They're all Apollo

                <li>Document ND1002324 (all revisions), for the Block I
                  CM (specifically, CM-014), running SUNSPOT
                  software.&nbsp; According to <a
                    href="hrst/archive/1690.pdf">this document</a> (p.
                  15), CM-014 was used only for testing and was
                  eventually scrapped in 1977.&nbsp; Since the CM was
                  never used for anything other than testing, it's
                  entirely possible that its AGC still had SUNSPOT ropes
                  in it when the CM scrapped, and thus it seems possible
                  that that Block I AGC (or its rope-modules separately)
                  are still floating around somewhere.&nbsp; In other
                  words, SUNSPOT may be recoverable by dumping the
                  contents of those rope modules, if they (and/or their
                  AGC) are ever found.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I neither
                  know where the AGC nor its rope modules are, nor do I
                  know of anyone who has <i>successfully</i> dumped the

                  433</a> has also been scanned.&nbsp; It contains many
                more documents than Box 434, so I won't list them all
                here.&nbsp; They are principally process specifications
                and testing procedures.&nbsp; The most-notable document,
                I think, is ND1002319, "ACE-S/C Computer Subprogram
                Specifications for Apollo CM and LM G&amp;N Testing",

              163 and LUMINARY 173</a> source code.&nbsp; Of course,
            I've also taken the much simpler step of adding support for
            them to the VirtualAGC GUI program.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            These were the first and second revisions of LUMINARY
            targeted for the Apollo 14 mission, and their memory modules
            were manufactured but not flown.&nbsp; (Instead, <a
              href="Luminary.html#Luminary178">LUMINARY 178</a>, the
            final released version, which Mike managed to finish
            reconstructing a few days ago, was actually flown.)&nbsp; So
            in just a few days, we've gone from having essentially
            nothing for the Apollo 14 Lunar Module, software-wise, to
            having pretty much everything you'd ever need to know!<br>
            <br>
            It probably goes without saying, but beyond just their
            intrinsic interest on their own, having the complete set
            (163 &amp; 173 &amp; 178) further increases our confidence
            in the reconstruction of each of them individually.&nbsp;
            That's because the reconstruction of 163 is <i>based on</i>
            173, while the reconstruction of 173 is <i>based on</i>
            178.&nbsp; We have confidence in the reconstruction of 178
            because its checksums are correct ... but there's a <i>small</i>
            though non-zero chance that an incorrect memory bank could
            still have a correct checksum.&nbsp; However, it's still
            unlikelier that you could modify an <i>incorrect</i> memory
            bank (from 178) having a <i>correct</i> checksum and
            somehow obtain another bank (from 173) that also had a
            correct checksum, and then modify that bank again to get
            still a third bank (from 163) having a correct
            checksum.&nbsp; Admittedly, that argument doesn't apply to <i>all</i>
            of the memory banks in the program, since not all of them
            needed to be reconstructed for each of these software
            revisions, but it applies to enough of them to give us a
            good feeling that the reconstruction process does exactly
            what we hope it's doing.<br>

              <li>Mike Stewart has managed a true <i>tour de force</i>,
                by reconstructing and contributing the reconstructed <a
                  href="Luminary.html#Luminary178">LUMINARY 178</a>
                source code.&nbsp; LUMINARY 178, you may recall is the
                LM's AGC program for the Apollo 14 mission.&nbsp; It has
                been a sore spot for me for a while, in that we've had
                the LUMINARY code for all <i>other</i> flown missions —
                i.e, Apollo 10-13 and 15-17 — for a long time ... but
                not Apollo 14.&nbsp; It has been the only one
                missing.&nbsp; This is quibbling a little bit, I admit,
                since it ignores Apollo 5 and Apollo 9.&nbsp; But
                technically those missions didn't use LUMINARY; Apollo 5
                used SUNBURST (which we have!) and Apollo 9 used
                SUNDANCE (which we don't!).&nbsp; So I guess the missing
                SUNDANCE will now become the sore spot.&nbsp; But I
                digress.&nbsp; Finally filling in the gap for Apollo 14
                is great no matter how you look at it, but what makes it
                a <i>tour de force</i>, is the <i>vast</i> gap that
                this fills in terms of software changes.&nbsp; The
                Apollo 13 and 15 LM&nbsp; software were LUMINARY 131 and
                210, respectively ... that's 79 revisions in between,
                with Apollo 14 being smack dab in the middle.&nbsp;
                Amazing!&nbsp; So the reconstruction requires figuring
                out the changes for something like 30-50
                revisions.&nbsp; Getting to the end of that process is
                like finding the missing link.&nbsp; It makes the slogan
                you see in the website logo ("Apollo Digital
                Archaeology") seem quite appropriate.&nbsp; Not only is
                the code <a

              </li>
              <li>On a lesser note, I've finally finished proofing the <a
                  href="LVDC.html">LVDC</a> source code's program
                comments.&nbsp; Experience suggests there are still
                quite a few errors I missed.&nbsp; Nevertheless, given
                that the code has been proofed, and assembles to exactly
                the expected core-rope image, I'm finally willing to put
                my stamp of approval on it and say that it's
                "ready".&nbsp; If only ITAR concerns allowed me to

            but the one that particularly stands out for me is
            Raytheon's 1969 "<a href="Documents/19700015154.pdf">Final
              Report: Apollo Guidance Computer Program Block I (100) and
              Block II</a>". Don't be confused by the title referring to
            the "program", since the report is <i>not</i> about
            software.&nbsp; The report is a nice way of getting a
            pretty-detailed understanding of all the different hardware
            Raytheon produced for the program, including all the AGCs,
            DSKYs, and associated ground-support equipment, which is
            pretty hard to get piecemeal from other documentation.&nbsp;
            I was particularly enamored of <a
              href="explodedDskyBlockII.jpg">an exploded diagram for the
              Block II DSKY</a> that I don't recall having seen before,
            to the extent that I even pulled it out of the report and
            added it to <a href="yaDSKY.html">the DSKY page</a>.&nbsp;
            I'm sure there's nothing in the diagram that you can't get

          <td valign="top">I've unfortunately discovered that our one
            LVDC program listing does not form a complete LVDC
            program.&nbsp; Or at least, that's the conclusion I've come
            to, and until there's some reasonable independent review of
            the code, I fear that my inferences are the only ones that
            count.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll eventually turn out to be wrong.<br>
            <br>
            When I say it's incomplete, I <i>don't</i> mean that there
            are pages missing from the program listing, or anything of
            that nature.&nbsp; The Flight Program listing we have is
            completely self-contained, and can be assembled without
            error ... or at least <i>could</i> be assembled without
            error if a handful of undebugged problems in this
            engineering (as opposed to released) version of the code
            were fixed.<br>
            <br>
            No, what I mean is that the Flight Program was not the <i>only</i>
            program that needed to be loaded into LVDC core memory to
            get a complete working system.&nbsp; At the present time, I
            believe that the missing program would have been the
            Preflight Program.&nbsp; The Flight Program and Preflight
            Program would have interacted via certain addresses
            hard-coded into those programs.&nbsp; Unfortunately, right
            now, when the Flight Program calls routines that are
            supposed to reside at those addresses, there's simply
            nothing there, and chaos would ensue.<br>
            <br>
            For example, I think that one thing the Preflight Program
            probably had was the self-test routine.&nbsp; Very
            handy!&nbsp; And very unhandy not to have it.&nbsp; By the
            same token, a self-test routine is hardly <i>essential</i>
            to the operation of the system, and it might be possible to
            make the Flight Program happy simply by sticking some kind
            of relatively-simple replacement for it at its specified
            hard-coded address.&nbsp; And all of the other problematic
            addresses I've seen similarly relate to code that might be
            painlessly worked around.&nbsp; But I don't have a complete
            survey of all the offending missing code, and can't really
            make too positive a claim at this point.&nbsp; Time will
            tell how serious a problem this turns out to be.<br>

                2004739A-000 and -021, DSKY front cover.&nbsp; This is
                significant because it turns out that model 2004929
                (also DSKY front cover) added a couple of weeks ago was
                not the one called out for DSKY model 2003994-121 at
                all, and that 2004739 is what should be used.&nbsp; This
                was not just an oversight, though!&nbsp; The problem is
                that drawing 2004739 simply isn't dimensioned very
                thoroughly, whereas 2004929 is dimensioned quite
                thoroughly, so the hope was that 2004929 would be a good
                substitute.&nbsp; Alas, it was not!&nbsp; Some of the
                dimensions (specifically the width and height of
                openings for the indicator lamps) from drawing 2004929
                are not compatible with the other constituent assemblies
                in DSKY 2003994-121.&nbsp; Thus while the new models for
                2004739 are intended to be exact representations of the
                original drawing, there's not enough detail on the
                original drawing to insure that; so the new models
                contain both elements from 2004929, as well as
                measurements which were fortunately able to be gotten
                from a physical 2004739 module.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the
                potential for error remains and thus the models may need
                to be further adjusted over time.</li>
              <li>10 new document scans from NARA SW have been

                and to GSOP changes from Apollo 13 to 14.&nbsp; Rather

                  models for DSKY parts</a>.&nbsp; It should be noted
                that the first two of those models listed below are
                created from the <i>external</i> dimensional properties
                of "Specification Control Drawings" (SCD).&nbsp; That's
                significant because the these assemblies were
                manufactured independently, and while they are really
                themselves assemblies, the internal characteristics of
                the assemblies are (well, <i>were</i>) known only to
                the manufacturers of the assemblies.&nbsp; In other
                words, there are no available drawings describing their
                internal structures.&nbsp; Consequently, you can't
                simply 3D print them and expect that they'll do anything
                for you, particularly since they contain circuitry not
                represented by the 3D models.&nbsp; They'll need to be
                reverse engineered in order to reproduce their
                electrical and behavioral characteristics.&nbsp; The
                third model is also problematic, because we don't have
                the latest revision of its original drawing.&nbsp;
                That's significant, because most DSKY's specify use of
                configuration -001 of the part, while the most-recent
                drawing we have covers only up to configuration
                -000.&nbsp; Consequently, the 3D model also conforms
                only to configuration -000 rather than to the necessary
                -001, and therefore also likely requires modification.<br>

                not every single one!)&nbsp; I probably should have
                mentioned too that the models being added so far are
                intended to precisely capture the original Apollo
                engineering drawings, and hence do not include any
                optimizations for (for example) 3D printing; alternate
                3D models with such optimizations may be added in the
                future.&nbsp; Also, for those who haven't stayed atop
                the behind-the-scenes discussions, it's perhaps useful
                information that the models are in <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21">STEP</a>
                format, which can be imported into most 3D modeling
                programs, but specifically into the open-source <a
                  href="https://www.freecadweb.org/">FreeCAD</a>
                modeler.&nbsp; I probably should summarize what those
                parts are, too, rather than forcing you to figure it out
                for yourself.&nbsp; Here's the complete list so far:</li>

                <li>2004900A, rear cover</li>
                <li>2004919E, adapter plate</li>

                <li>2004968E, front housing</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Mike has confidently reconstructed yet another AGC
                software version, this time <a
                  href="Colossus.html#ARTEMIS71">Artemis 71</a>.&nbsp;
                As you may recall, Artemis 72 is the software actually
                flown in the Apollo 15 through 17 Command Modules.&nbsp;
                But Artemis 71 was originally intended to do so.&nbsp;
                Artemis 72 flew instead, because of a bug fix.&nbsp; As
                with all these software reconstructions that have been
                appearing lately, we have no actual assembly listing of
                Artemis 71 to work from.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the clues
                present in the Artemis 72 assembly listing, in concert
                with the Artemis 71 memory-bank checksums (which we have
                from engineering drawing 2021154), allow us not only to
                infer the required changes, but to verify them
                afterward.&nbsp; Great work, Mike!&nbsp; The VirtualAGC
                GUI program now supports Artemis 71 as well, so you can
                run Artemis 71 or browse its source code in VirtualAGC
                if you like.</li>

                poorly-written instructions in so far as the
                requirements on the 3D models, as well as practically
                non-existent instructions on how to actually submit them

              <li>A handful of documents added to the library a few
                weeks ago have now been removed.&nbsp; Well, perhaps a
                handful and a half.&nbsp; For the most part, I've done
                this by expunging the files themselves, but leaving the
                hyperlinks on <a href="links.html">the document library
                  page</a> and striking them out (<strike>thusly</strike>)
                so that it's easy to see what has been removed.&nbsp;
                These documents originally came from <a
                  href="https://www.sti.nasa.gov/">NTRS</a>, but were
                removed from NTRS when it was decided by NASA that they
                hadn't been approved for release; so now they've been
                removed from Virtual AGC too.&nbsp; Sweet!&nbsp; I don't
                actually know if it was necessary to remove them, but it
                has been done as a precaution.&nbsp; Of the 1000+
                documents we provide, who knows how many have thus been
                (or will be) taken retroactively out of the public
                domain, with no practical way for us to even know about
                it or react to it?&nbsp; (Hint: We don't.)&nbsp; Can you
                spell "time bomb waiting to go off"?&nbsp; (Hint:&nbsp;
                You don't have to.&nbsp; I just spelled it out for
                you.)&nbsp; Or perhaps, "closing the stable door after
                the horse has bolted"?&nbsp; (Hint:&nbsp; Ditto.)&nbsp;
                For what it's worth, I think the documents are available
                on <a href="https://archive.org/web/">The Wayback
                  Machine</a>'s cache of NTRS, if you can figure out how
                to find them, and with luck perhaps they'll return here

              <li>Speaking of secret knowledge, I've finished my first
                pass at transcribing the LVDC AS-206RAM assembly listing
                to source code, but am afraid now to post it publicly
                because of ITAR and the danger that North Koreans may
                start pelting us with Saturn V or Saturn IB rockets if
                they get hold of this 50-year-old software
                listing.&nbsp; (The projected cost of a <a

                mission is probably only around $220M.&nbsp; A bargain,
                to a thrifty hawk!&nbsp; To be fair, when I wrote those
                sentences, they were intended to be biting sarcasm, but
                given that <a

              <li>Mike has added yet another AGC software
                reconstruction, this time of <a
                  href="Colossus.html#COMANCHE51">the Comanche 51 source
                  code</a>.&nbsp; Comanche 51 was the program that was
                first targeted for the Apollo 11 Command Module, though
                it was Comanche 55 that eventually flew in the
                mission.&nbsp; Reconstruction of all these intermediate
                AGC software versions may strike you as merely an
                intellectual game, which I suppose it is in some ways,
                but it has serious benefits as well.&nbsp; For example,
                I'll remind you that a few days ago we got the Luminary
                69/2 reconstruction, and this was actually mission
                software (for the Apollo 10 LM) that we hadn't had
                originally.&nbsp; In the case of Comanche, the Holy
                Grail would be reconstruction of Comanche 45/2, which is
                the missing mission software for the Apollo 10 CM.&nbsp;
                Having Comanche 51 rather than just Comanche 55 gets us
                that much closer to the goal.&nbsp; Even so, getting
                from Comanche 51 to 45/2 is quite hard, since we don't
                have the level of supporting documentation for Colossus
                that we do for Luminary.&nbsp; A reconstruction of 45/2
                would be ever so much easier if Margaret Hamilton just
                gave us her copy of Comanche 44 ... though that, sadly,
                seems less likely with every passing year.&nbsp; But
                we'll see what we'll see!</li>

                the same procedure as for the Luminary 130 and 69 rev 2
                reconstructions over the last couple of days.&nbsp;
                There's slightly less confidence in the Luminary 98
                reconstruction than in the 97 reconstruction, since back
                in 1969 Luminary 98 was just development software <i>en
                  route</i> from 97 to 99, so its ropes were never
                manufactured nor its memory-bank checksums
                recorded.&nbsp; However, if Mike's Luminary 98
                reconstruction were in error, his 97 reconstruction
                would probably be in error as well ... which is unlikely
                since all of <i>its</i> memory-bank checksums are
                correct!&nbsp; In other words, while we're less
                confident of the Luminary 98 reconstruction than in the
                97 reconstruction, we still have a pretty high degree of
                confidence in it.</li>
              <li> On our Luminary page, I long ago hyperlinked the raw

                conniption, I belatedly find that I never did that on <a

                Eyles at the time that I was thinking only about the
                Lunar Module and not about the Command Module at
                all.&nbsp; Well, I have finally taken care of it now!<br>

                interested in software actually flown.&nbsp; On the
                other hand, it is becoming increasingly obvious that the
                more software versions we collect the easier it is to
                fill in the gaps between them, so it's nothing to be
                pooh-poohed by any means!&nbsp; (Excuse me, I mean
                P00H-P00H'ed.)&nbsp; Plus, various Apollo 13 documents
                referenced Luminary 130 anyway, and were never revised
                for 131, as far as we know.&nbsp; <br>

                thumbnails I've embedded in the tables on the Luminary

                when the windows were made smaller the text overflowed
                to the right and needed scrollbars to see.&nbsp; I can't
                get rid of this effect entirely, but making the
                thumbnails smaller mitigated it somewhat.</li>

                subsequent creation of a lunar lander game (Cowlark)
                written in Cowgol.&nbsp; In other words, Cowlark is a

              through 2021154</a>, astoundingly list all of the
            memory-bank checksums for lots of AGC programs ... including
            lots of revisions of programs that we don't have.&nbsp; This
            information, which may seem rather pointless on the face of
            it, actually opens up the door for reconstructing a lot of
            software revisions we don't have. Why?&nbsp; Well, we do
            have source code for an increasingly-large number of
            Luminary and Colossus software revisions, <i>and</i> we
            often have LUMINARY Memos or COLOSSUS Memos that tell us in
            a descriptive way which changes were made between successive
            revisions of the software. This is especially true for
            Luminary.&nbsp; Thus from the <i>descriptions</i> of the
            changes, we can attempt to back-port those changes (as
            observed in later revisions of the software) into earlier
            versions of the software and then <i>check</i> if those
            changes produced the proper memory-bank checksums!&nbsp;
            We've done this in the past in the handful of cases where we
            knew the checksums of unavailable software revisions, but we
            never had such checksums for a large number of missions to
            work with before.<br>

            Thanks, Mike, once again!&nbsp; So while yesterday we had
            Apollo 10 LM software that was "close enough", today we are
            pretty sure we have the exact software used in the mission.<br>

              <li>It turns out that my comments yesterday about SUNDIAL
                D vs SUNDIAL E in the 2TV-1 mission were
                misguided.&nbsp; What I <i>should</i> have been saying
                was that the fixed-memory modules (which are what holds
                the SUNDIAL program) were different than what what the
                engineering documentation led us to believe:&nbsp;
                specifically, if you're interested, MIT's AGC contains
                software assembly 2021104-051 rather than the
                2021104-041 we expected.&nbsp; However, Mike has managed
                to find documentation that both of those assemblies held
                SUNDIAL E software anyway, so it hardly matters which
                one was installed in the computer.&nbsp; Thus I can
                happily contradict what I said in yesterday's
                entry:&nbsp; We truly do have the software for the 2TV-1
                mission!&nbsp; I've altered <a
                  href="Colossus.html#2TV1">the description on the
                  COLOSSUS page</a> to reflect that fact.</li>
              <li> The VirtualAGC GUI program has now been updated (at
                GitHub) to have the 2TV-1 mission as one of the options.</li>
              <li>Added a series of documents (thanks, Graham Donald!)
                to the library, concerning potential applications of the
                LM.&nbsp; Also, quite by chance, I found a <a
                  href="Documents/R-700.pdf">grayscale scan of document
                  R-700</a> online that's fantastic, compared to the
                B&amp;W scans we already had, because you can actually <i>see</i>
                the photographs; naturally I snatched it and stuck it in
                the document library too.<br>

              <li>Much like with the RETREAD 50 AGC software we added a
                few weeks ago, <a href="Restoration.html">the AGC
                  Restoration team</a> has now dumped the rope memory

                program SUNDIAL E.&nbsp; This is our first look at
                SUNDIAL.&nbsp; SUNDIAL E is close to, but presumably not
                exactly the same as, the SUNDIAL D software used for the
                2TV-1 mission, so <a href="Colossus.html#2TV1">that's
                  how I've categorized it on our COLOSSUS page</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;




























































































































































































                In a larger sense, I think that SUNDIAL was generally
                used for system checkout of Command Modules, much as
                AURORA was for Lunar Modules.&nbsp; We don't have the
                source code yet, since the restoration team has been so
                busy, but presumably Mike will churn it out for us in
                the reasonably-near future by comparing to similar
                program versions and judicious disassembly.&nbsp; The
                binary is apparently ready-to-run in yaAGC, though I
                have not made the necessary changes yet to do so within
                the VirtualAGC GUI environment.</li>
              <li>At the same time, 3 out of the 6 rope modules for the
                program SUNDANCE 302 were dumped, and have been added to

                  GitHub repository</a>.&nbsp; I've not written up
                anything about it on the LUMINARY page yet, though,
                because I haven't figured out yet how to go about
                describing <i>half</i> of a program.&nbsp; The idea, of
                course, is to try and find the other half of it later.<br>
              </li>
              <li>In thrashing out whether SUNDIAL E was or was not used
                in 2TV-1, it became apparent that some of the
                compatibility tables in documents ND-1021042 and
                ND-1021043 could be used to fill in a couple of
                missing-link engineering drawings related to
                configurations of SUNDIAL and AURORA, so I've now done
                that and regenerated the assembly drilldowns of the
                engineering drawings accordingly.<br>

            perfectly legible scan is ready, though I may make a better
            one later.&nbsp; I've actually been taking this opportunity
            to try out different digitizing methods, so I've scanned the
            thing 4 times so far.&nbsp; That's because I've been very
            dissatisfied with the AGC listings I scanned in the past,
            and I wanted to perfect my method once and for all.&nbsp;
            But because I'm experimenting, the scans aren't quite as
            pretty yet as I'd like.&nbsp; Getting better, though.<br>
            <br>
            <a href="LVDC.html#Evolution_of_the_Flight_Software">As I
              explain in more detail on the LVDC page</a>, we are not
            certain yet about the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations">ITAR</a>
            status of this assembly listing:&nbsp; Maybe ITAR restricts
            who the program can be given to ... and maybe it
            doesn't.&nbsp; I kind of think it doesn't.&nbsp; I hope
            we'll eventually find out for sure that it doesn't, and I'll
            then be able to post the scans online.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
            until/unless the legal issue is resolved, it's a close
            enough call that I'll have to assume by default that ITAR <i>does</i>
            restrict access.&nbsp; So if you want the scanned program
            listing, you'll not only have to <strike>email me directly</strike>
            apply to me <i>in person</i>, but you'll also have to
            provide reasonable proof that you're a U.S. citizen,
            tolerate the fact that I'll send you only an encrypted,
            identifiable, watermarked PDF, and be okay with the fact
            that I'll retain a permanent record of you and of the proof
            you provided.&nbsp; That's because ITAR restricts access to
            foreigners but explicitly allows distribution to U.S.
            citizens.&nbsp; The upshot is that if it turns out ITAR <i>does</i>
            restrict access and the listing does end up somehow in
            foreign hands, and somebody does show up at my door with a
            subpoena ... well, <i>my</i> personal posterior will be
            covered, because <i>I</i> will have handed the program only
            to verifiable U.S. citizens.<br>
            <br>
            I've also done a preliminary pass on looking through the
            listing and have written up all my observations and
            inferences about the the syntax and pseudo-operations of
            LVDC assembly language, as well as about the AS-206RAM
            program itself.&nbsp; That's a prerequisite for getting a
            working LVDC assembler, which along with transcribing the
            listing's source code is hopefully the next step.&nbsp; (And
            no, sorry, once I have transcribed the source code, it won't
            be freely distributable either until ITAR questions are
            resolved for the better.)<br>

                  first actual IBM LVDC source code</a>, from a 1967
                version of the LVDC flight program!&nbsp; It's just a
                few pages of trig and square root routines, but you can
                see from the snapshots that there's a full (or at least
                very substantial) program listing beyond just those few
                samples.&nbsp; It probably does not conform 100% to the
                syntax of the assembler I wrote for it a decade ago, but
                obviously at some point I'll fix up the assembler.&nbsp;
                Unfortunately, my anonymous informant does <i>not</i>
                indicate that we will be receiving the full listing, and
                indeed implies very strongly that we will not.&nbsp; So
                I can't you promise anything further.&nbsp; Which is
                disappointing.&nbsp; But the very positive takeaway is
                that assembly listings of the LVDC flight program do
                still exist ... a possibility which previous informants

            drawing 2010094-, which is the READ COUNTER MODULE of
            apparently all Block II Coupling Data Units (CDUs).&nbsp; In
            other words, it is our first CAD transcription of a G&amp;N
            schematic <i>not</i> for the AGC or DSKY.&nbsp; It's a real
            monster, too, at least in terms of physical size, 130"×34",
            though that's mainly because they didn't choose to split the
            drawing into multiple sheets, even though physically it
            consists of 4 separate, almost-independent
            "quadrants".&nbsp; Go figure! <br>
            <br>
            If you've never given the CDU any thought — and I know I
            hadn't! — it's interesting and eerie the way it shadows the
            AGC design.&nbsp; In particular, it consist of "modules",
            plugged into a backplane, with each module being either a
            regular analog circuit or else a "logic-flow" circuit
            consisting entirely of NOR gates.&nbsp; I suppose it's
            reasonable that once they had a design paradigm they'd
            probably stick with it, but it's still fun to see.&nbsp; The
            CDU itself converts data from whatever forms it's available
            in the spacecraft to whatever digital format the AGC needs,
            and vice-versa, so you can think of it crudely as a set of
            A/D and D/A converters ... but from an era where such things
            didn't just come off-the-shelf but had to be designed and
            implemented anew with each project.<br>
            <br>
            But it's also based on a circuit-design practice that we
            associate only with Block I and <i>early</i> Block
            II.&nbsp; For example, the schematic shows no pin numbers
            for the NOR gates, nor distinguishes between the "A" and "B"
            gates of the dual-NOR-gate chips.&nbsp; For that information
            you have to look at an entirely separate drawing, the
            so-called "signal wiring" diagram.&nbsp; That design
            practice fortunately fell out of favor quickly in the AGC
            schematics (thank heaven!), but unfortunately persisted to
            the very end in the CDU schematics ... or at least in the
            CDU READ COUNTER MODULE.&nbsp; As a result, I can't claim
            total confidence of the NOR-gate pin numbers used in the CAD
            transcription, due to the difficulty of proofreading them;
            on the up side, though, probably nobody will ever notice if
            I didn't get some of them quite right!<br>

              <li>In doing some semi-automated checking of the G&amp;N
                assembly drilldowns, I've discovered to my horror that a
                lot of drawings that you'd never suspect were assemblies
                actually are assemblies.&nbsp; Maybe 90% of them!&nbsp;
                I mean, really, who would suspect that something called
                a "cover" or a "plate" is really an assembly?&nbsp; I
                ask you.&nbsp; I never even bothered to look at
                them.&nbsp; The upshot of that is that the assembly
                drilldowns I've made are actually nowhere near as
                complete as I imagined, since I didn't have any support
                for drilling down a bunch of those non-assembly
                assemblies (with apologies to Woodward &amp;
                Bernstein).&nbsp; So I've made a tentative new beginning
                with some updates to the drilldowns, but there's a long
                way to go.</li>
              <li>But there's a bit of a treat today as well:&nbsp; <a
                  href="AgcDrawingIndex.html#GAEC">We've gotten a few
                  top-level LM engineering drawings</a> from the
                aperture-card boxes at NARA-SW, and perhaps someday
                we'll be able to explore the LM engineering drawings in
                much the same way we're now exploring the G&amp;N
                engineering drawings.&nbsp; Check them out!&nbsp; One
                drawback with them is that while each drawing calls out
                the drawings for its sub-assemblies, it does so only by
                drawing number and no drawing name.&nbsp; Furthermore,
                the drawings themselves have only numbers in their title
                blocks, and have no actual titles.&nbsp; So I can't
                personally tell you what most of the assemblies
                are.&nbsp; Anyone who wants to offer up a solution to
                this conundrum, please do so, since it will make
                figuring out these assemblies quite difficult!<br>

              Apollo G&amp;N assembly drilldowns</a> have now been

              new Apollo G&amp;N assembly drilldowns</a> that I
            mentioned in my previous note have now been completed, and
            have been fleshed out with lots of mil-spec parts as

            old manually-created drilldowns ... not that they had
            nothing to offer, but I don't think they had enough to offer
            to justify the added confusion of the presentation.&nbsp;
            Both the old and new drilldowns had some errors with respect
            to each other, but neither seemed to be obviously better in
            that respect.&nbsp; It will be some time before I'm able to

              way the electro-mechanical page displays the hierarchy of
              engineering drawings</a>.&nbsp; I won't bore you with
            details, except to say that generation of this hierarchical
            representation is now automated, whereas before it was
            entirely manual, and that this will have (and already does
            have) tremendous advantages.&nbsp; There is still a lot of
            stuff to check (and presumably fix!) in the new
            representation, and in particular the Block I data is very
            incomplete.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I've decided to take it live
            rather than to keep dragging my feet on it.&nbsp; The older,
            manually-generated presentation continues to be provided as
            a fallback, and will remain until the new presentation firms
            up a bit.&nbsp; The presentation-generation software may
            also be useful to some users, particularly if they need to
            have part-count data, since the software outputs JSON in
            addition to HTML.&nbsp; Moreover, there's a comparison
            program that can compare two different assemblies, given
            their JSON.<br>
            <br>
            The new representation appears to have a lot more missing
            drawings in it than the old one does, but that's a bit
            misleading.&nbsp; Many of the missing drawings are SCDs or
            drawings for G&amp;N components we just haven't been
            collecting until recently, and therefore the gaps will
            hopefully fill in significantly as the effort of scanning
            the engineering-drawing microfilm at NARA SW proceeds.&nbsp;
            Naturally, they'll never fill in completely.<br>

              yaDSKY page of the website</a>, the mission-by-mission
            arrangements of the DSKY indicator lamps and their colors
            that I posted yesterday also had errors, because they were
            based on the wrong DSKY part numbers.&nbsp; That has been
            fixed, with the result (not too surprisingly) that the
            Apollo 12 LM did have the same indicator lamp arrangement as
            the other missions, rather than a different one as I claimed
            yesterday, and Apollo 5 did as well. <br>
            <br>
            This issue with Apollo 5 is actually slightly interesting,
            in that it turns out there were engineering drawings both
            for the configurations MIT <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch20190219Images#page/n82/mode/1up"><i>delivered</i></a>
            to NASA and separate engineering drawings for those NASA
            actually <a
href="https://archive.org/stream/AgcApertureCardsBatch20190219Images#page/n79/mode/1up"><i>installed</i></a>
            in the spacecraft.&nbsp; These two configurations usually
            call out different AGC and DSKY part numbers.&nbsp; That
            distinction, along with some other subtleties, escaped me
            when creating the drilldown table.&nbsp; For example, MIT
            delivered DSKY 2003985-051 for Apollo 5 (or rather for
            G&amp;N system 603 for LM-1), which has a rather funky
            indicator-lamp arrangement; but NASA ended up installing
            DSKY 2003985-081, which has a "normal" arrangement.&nbsp;
            Who knew?&nbsp; Well, obviously, a lot of people other than
            me!&nbsp; There are changes like that across the board,
            though only this one involved a change in the DSKY's
            lamps.&nbsp; Just one more reason to be careful, I suppose.<br>

                  (2005940A) yesterday and say exactly the same thing
                  about it?!!!</i>&nbsp; Why yes, I did, thank you for
                noticing.&nbsp; DSKY 2003994 is one of only a handful of
                cases I've encountered in which there's an inconsistency
                in its drawing tree as to which schematic is
                applicable.&nbsp; The indicator driver module assembly
                (2003952-031) for DSKY 2003994 calls out schematic
                drawing 2005940, whereas the relay circuit assembly
                (2003910-021) of that selfsame indicator driver module
                assembly calls out schematic drawing 2005973
                instead.&nbsp; The two schematics are almost, but not
                quite, identical.&nbsp; Unfortunately there's no way to
                know for certain which is which with the information we
                have at present.&nbsp; Often in this case, we'd resort
                to looking at AC Electronics document ND-1021042, but it
                is <i>also</i> inconsistent, calling out schematic
                2005973 in some places, but showing circuitry from
                2005940 in others.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there are quite a
                few circumstantial reasons to believe that 2005973 is
                the correct one ... not least of which that its
                signatures are dated later.&nbsp; You can read all of my
                reasoning on that, in my usual boring detail, on any of

              <li>Back when I originally did the engineering-drawing
                drill-downs for the various AGC and DSKY models that are
                listed on <a
                  href="ElectroMechanical.html#Browse_the_Available_Engineering">the

























































































































































































































































































































































                  electro-mechanical page</a>, there were a number of
                drill-downs I couldn't complete, due to missing
                drawings.&nbsp; Well, there are still missing drawings,
                but in the meantime we've acquired lots and lot more
                scans than before, so it should be possible to fill in <i>some</i>
                of those gaps.&nbsp; While it's still early in the
                process of filling in the gaps, here are some of the
                assemblies whose drill-downs have been addressed so far:</li>

                  transcription for drawing 2005971</a> (power-supply

                <a href="KiCad/2005971-A">the renderings of the CAD as
                  image files</a>. Unlike my normal practice, I took
                some liberties with this one, in that the latest
                revision of the original drawing 2005971 we have is "A",
                but it is missing its 2nd sheet (the bill of
                materials).&nbsp; I therefore transcribed sheet 1 from
                the original 2005971A, but I transcribed sheet 2 from
                the original 2005971-, thus producing a hybrid revision
                that I call "2005971-A".&nbsp; I've compared the
                resistor, capacitor, and inductor values between the two
                sheets to insure there are no obvious revision
                mismatches between the two sheets, but there's no way to
                detect incorrect part numbers for things like diodes and
                transistors.&nbsp; Not that it matters too much, since
                you probably can't get those diodes or transistors any
                longer, but I still don't like it.</li>

            At any rate, I've created a little python program to track

            just been trivial things like missing commas that don't make
            any difference, but it did manage to find and fix 10-12

                  Apollo online digital archive of the University of
                  Alabama at Huntsville</a>, having apparently been
                offline for a couple of years, has returned from
                whatever limbo it may have been in.&nbsp; It contains
                around a thousand documents.&nbsp; I've leafed through
                all of them and pulled down 40 or so for <a
                  href="links.html">our own digital library page</a>
                just in case the UAH site decides to disappear
                again.&nbsp; You can find them in our library by looking
                for the <img alt="" src="new.png" height="16"
                  width="36"> icon.&nbsp; As you might imagine, though,
                given that almost all of this stuff came from Marshall
                Space Flight Center, most of the UAH documents relate to
                the big rocket, and mostly have little direct relevance
                to what's going on here at Virtual AGC.&nbsp; Most of
                the ones I pulled relate to Saturn IV-B stage
                (containing the Instrumentation Unit, containing the
                Launch Vehicle Digital Computer), or to the Apollo
                Telescope Mount (Skylab), or to press materials for
                Apollo 4 through 7. thanks, Hartmuth!</li>
              <li>Thymo van Beers sent me a list of various boo-boos in
                my own AGC developer documentation that need to be
                fixed, and after lazily sitting on that list for a while
                — a couple of months, it looks like — I've finally
                gotten around to incorporating his suggestions.&nbsp;

            <a href="TipueSearch.html">engineering-drawing search engine</a>

            the titles shown in the index for box 462 or in the search
            engine are still the 21-character abbreviated names from the
            aperture-card metadata, rather than the full ones from the
            drawings' actual title blocks.&nbsp; So that's something
            I'll still want to fix up, hopefully in the near future.<br>

              electrical CAD transcriptions of AGC/DSKY schematics</a>
            had been bothering me, such as wires that weren't <i>precisely</i>
            vertical or horizontal, extraneous junctions (fat dots) that
            were present because of tiny unnecessary wire segments, tiny
            jogs in a wire, and so forth.&nbsp; So I created a little
            program (which I cleverly call "eelint") to locate such
            problems in the schematic files, after which I then went
            through and "fixed" all of them.&nbsp; I also reran ERC
            (electrical rule check), netlist generation, and image
            rendering on the schematics I fixed, just to make sure I
            didn't break stuff in the process of fixing it.&nbsp; I ran
            into the slight problem that KiCad ERC had itself broken in
            the meantime, so I had to wait a few days for a kind KiCad
            developer to make it work for me again. <img
              src="smiley.png" alt="" height="16" width="16">&nbsp;
            "Fixed" is in quotes earlier, because I imagine few other
            people would be bothered by such trivial stuff, and probably
            just think it was unnecessary grinding on my part.&nbsp; On
            the plus side, though, KiCad's ERC capability (once it was
            working again) had advanced somewhat since I had originally
            run it on these schematics, so it also found a handful of
            actual electrical problems for me that I was able to
            fix.&nbsp; Thus the exercise wasn't <i>entirely</i>
            pointless.&nbsp; For anyone unlucky enough to have hardcoded
            some links or shortcuts to <a href="KiCad">the PNG files in
              our rendered CAD folder</a>, I'm pretty sure that I ended
            up changing the names of a few of those files, so you might
            want to check your links.&nbsp; My apologies for that.<br>

                  GitHub repository now has a "mechanical" branch</a>,
                into which I semi-confidently expect 3D models of AGC,
                DSKY, and perhaps other G&amp;N system component
                fabricated parts (such as baseboards, faceplates,
                covers, and so on) to be placed ... hopefully starting
                in the relatively near future.&nbsp; But it's just empty
                right now except for a README that covers my hopes and
                expectations in more detail.&nbsp; There's also a place
                there for storing 2D CAD transcriptions of scans of the
                original Project Apollo mechanical drawings, but people
                have expressed so little interest in that (compared to
                interest in 3D models) that we'll probably be able to
                count them on the fingers of one toe.<br>

              <li> Because of teething difficulties at the beginning of
                this process of scanning entire boxes of aperture cards,
                there are several instances in type 02 documents in
                which page 18 was misinterpreted as page 1, and thus the
                page 18 scan overwrote the page 1 scan; similarly, in
                which page 28 overwrote page 2 and page 38 overwrote
                page 3.&nbsp; This has been fixed in the Box 459, Box
                460, and Box 461 indices.&nbsp; I hope.&nbsp; There are
                also related cases in which multiple microfilms of the
                same drawing appear in the aperture-card boxes, but only
                once in our collection due to overwriting of files of
                the same name; this will be eliminated in future boxes
                (i.e., we'll have access to all of the scans, duplicate

              <li>As some sort of asinine tribute to the sickening power
                of cut-and-paste for evil, I had apparently titled
                drawings 2005251 through 2005273 in <a
                  href="AgcDrawingIndexBox460.html">Box 460</a> as
                "signal wiring diagrams", when they are really "logic
                flow diagrams".&nbsp; That's fixed.</li>
              <li>On the various engineering-drawing index pages, which
                usually provide links to our Internet Archive site for
                the individual drawing scans, there are warnings that
                using the Internet Archive's "save image as" function
                will usually give you an inferior image quality.&nbsp;
                However, I've found much better workarounds for that
                problem than when I originally wrote the warning, so
                I've modified those pages to give better advice about
                the workarounds.<br>

                (without literally checking all 3600 index entries) the
                indices are fine.&nbsp; It's definitely worth noting,
                though, that the indices were generated from the punches
                on the aperture cards holding the microfilms of the
                drawings, and that not only is the metadata punched
                there not 100% perfect or consistent, but more
                importantly, the scanner manufacturer's software that
                reads the punches during the scan is subject to all
                kinds of problems ... specifically, systematic
                substitution of some characters for other
                characters.&nbsp; Thus my index-generation software has
                to undo a lot of errors introduced by the scanning
                software, and that's impossible to do 100%
                perfectly.&nbsp; So I just hope it's good enough!&nbsp;
                So far, I think it is.&nbsp; Ask me again if I think so

                with the scanner, which I hope will be resolved fairly
                quickly, but am unsure enough of that to post the
                partial contents that have already been scanned ...
                about half the box.&nbsp; Or to put it more bluntly, the
                scanner is broken and needs to be repaired.&nbsp; Box
                461 gets into a lot of G&amp;N components we've ignored
                previously (IMU, SCT, PIPA, CDU) but it's only a taste
                of what's to come.<br>

            to add drilldowns for components that someone has expressed
            particular interest in.&nbsp; While I'm as OCD as the next

            pretty work-averse, I'm probably not going to do it for too
            many of these G&amp;N components at first.&nbsp; For now,
            I've just made the beginning steps associated with adding

            not-too-distant future.&nbsp; The CDUs manipulate data from
            the spacecraft into a format in which the AGC can input it,
            and conversely to manipulate data output by the AGC into a
            form in which the spacecraft can use it.&nbsp; Think of it
            as a set of analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog
            converters.&nbsp; In modern terms that sounds like a big "so
            what?"&nbsp; But in the Project Apollo era there were no
            dedicated ADC or DAC chips, and the CDU is a big deal.<br>

          <td valign="top">As a background task, I'm in the process now
            of trying to scan the <i>complete</i> set of MIT/IL
            electrical and mechanical engineering drawings stored at
            NARA SW.&nbsp; Up to now, I have only been picking and
            choosing the drawings I thought were absolutely needed, in
            order to save time and effort.&nbsp; However, complete scans
            have the advantage of overlooking nothing, and of producing
            much-more-legible scans.&nbsp; The process will take
            years.&nbsp; NARA SW has 1200 boxes, nominally of 2000
            "aperture cards" each, with each aperture card holding a
            microfilm slide of one scanned page.&nbsp; Only 47 of those
            boxes (#431 through #477) have specifically been associated
            <i>so far</i> with the MIT/IL G&amp;N drawings for
            Apollo.&nbsp; Many of the other boxes are known to be for
            Grumman, NAA/Rockwell, etc.&nbsp; So it's unclear just how
            many will need to be scanned in the end ... somewhere
            between 47 and 1196.&nbsp; <img src="smiley.png" alt=""
              height="16" width="16">&nbsp; The first two of these
            complete boxes, #459 and #460, have now become
            available.&nbsp; In order to keep our web-pages containing
            the drawing indexes from spiraling <i>too far</i> out of
            control, this has necessitated a change to the structure of
            the drawing indexes.&nbsp; Instead of a single, huge
            drawing-index page such as we had previously (which had
            about 5000 entries before complete boxes started becoming
            available), there will now be a series of such index pages,
            each relatively limited in scope:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>...</li>
              <li><a href="AgcDrawingIndexBox459.html">Index page for
                  box #459</a> (~1800 drawings)<br>
              </li>
              <li><a href="AgcDrawingIndexBox460.html">Index page for
                  box #460</a> (~1800 drawings)<br>
              </li>
              <li>...</li>
              <li><a href="AgcDrawingIndex.html">Miscellaneous index
                  page</a> (~5000 drawings)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since each aperture-card box corresponds to a specific,
              known drawing-number range, hopefully this will still be a
              relatively easy system to navigate.<br>
            </p>
            <p>I know that most people would handle this by setting up a
              database, so as to be able to find everything by browsing
              or searching the database rather than having hard-coded
              HTML tables of link data, but I'm philosophically
              committed to having a standalone website that doesn't need
              any software on the backend server, and hence could be
              (for example) downloaded to anybody's local system.&nbsp;
              Unfortunately, since (due to storage requirements) almost
              all of the engineering-drawing scans have been put onto
              our Internet Archive site rather than this main Virtual
              AGC site anyway, that principle is already
              invalidated.&nbsp; But still, my philosophy, website-wise,
              is "the dumber the better" in terms of its software
              requirements.&nbsp; And I'm sure that's obvious to anyone
              looking at this site who's <i>au fait</i> on such stuff.<br>

            Because the availability of the original drawings for the
            Block I DSKYs isn't 100% complete at present, I can't state
            with 100% certainty that these relay-module CAD
            transcriptions cover <i>all</i> models.&nbsp; But as far as
            I can tell with from the available drawings, they do.&nbsp;
            The two implementations appear identical at a glance, but
            have some pretty significant differences when you start
            looking at the details.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they fall into
            a kind of "uncanny valley" (yes, I know I'm using the term
            incorrectly) in which they are so similar that I felt I
            should create 1005780 by adapting the CAD for 1006161, and
            yet at the same time so different that I may have ended up
            spending more time correcting the adaptation than I would
            have simply by transcribing 1005780 from scratch.&nbsp;
            Which would make no difference to you, Dear Reader, I
            suppose, other than the fact that it means that it would
            have been all to easy for me to miss out on
            seeing/correcting errors in 1005780 ... which could still be
            lurking.&nbsp; On the good side, I suppose, it means that
            when I proofed 1005780 I was really doing an extra proofing
            of 1006161 by proxy, and thus was able to see (and correct)
            errors in it that I hadn't seen in my first proofing of
            it.&nbsp; On yet a third hand, however, both of them are so
            complex that I won't feel too confident in either of them
            until I've seen a simulation of some kind.&nbsp; (The nature
            of which is yet to be determined.)<br>
            <br>
            This actually completes the CAD transcription of all Block I
            DSKY schematics, and given that CAD transcription of the
            Block I AGC schematics had already been completed a couple
            of weeks ago, that means that I've now finished all of the
            Block I electrical CAD.&nbsp; Of course, you have to take
            that "all" with a grain of salt, since there's at least one
            known missing original drawing (later-model NAV DSKY keypad)
            which I obviously have not transcribed, and I haven't
            bothered with creating a schematic for the wiring that
            interconnects all of the DSKY modules.&nbsp; But I'm
            pronouncing it "done" anway.<br>
            <br>
            The next goal is filling in all of the gaps in the Block II
            electrical CAD transcriptions.&nbsp; I had completed Block
            II AGC model "2003200" (without any specific dash number)
            about 4 months ago, but the state of our knowledge of the
            specific engineering-drawing trees for the different
            AGC/DSKY models was primitive back then ... indeed,
            practically non-existent.&nbsp; So the task now is to get
            CAD transcriptions for the drawings for <i>all</i> of the
            specific Block II AGC &amp; DSKY models we're
            supporting.&nbsp; <br>

            Sadly, we don't actually have the electrical-schematic
            drawings for <i>later</i> models of either of these Block I
            DSKYs.&nbsp; It's worth noting that document ND-1021041 does

            detail to the schematics in ND-1021041, though a superficial
            comparison does show that our schematics for D17 are
            definitely not the final form of the design (though D18 may

                electro-mechanical page</a>.&nbsp; For two of those
              models (1003469-011 &amp; 1003700-011) we don't even have
              the specific original electrical schematics for module A23
              (namely drawing 1006125), while for two other models
              (1003700-051 &amp; -071) we don't have the electrical
              schematics for module A29 (drawing 1005763), so naturally
              there are no CAD transcriptions for those particular
              modules in those particular AGC models.&nbsp;
              Nevertheless, that's a lot of drawings transcribed to CAD,

            This turned out to be a bit trickier than usual because of a
            conundrum I ran into in the process, namely that the
            connector pins in the schematic are numbered in an
            impossible way.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; And having no idea
            what that meant, it brought me to a screeching halt,
            mid-transcription.&nbsp; I was tempted to just call it all a
            mistake on the original engineer's part, and renumber the
            connector pins as I liked in the transcribed CAD.&nbsp; But
            that strategy was a bit tricky to rationalize, since the
            original drawing was at revision "F" and thus had already
            been through multiple revisions without this problem (if it
            was one!) having been detected and corrected.&nbsp; Not only
            that, but the partial schematics that had been redrawn in AC
            Electronics document ND-1021041 <i>agreed</i> with the
            impossible numbering in the schematic, to the extent that
            ND-1021041 deigned to provide those kind of details.&nbsp;
            So what was happening?&nbsp; It was maddening!&nbsp; Had the
            spacetime continuum become not merely warped, but completely
            bent?&nbsp; Was it a sign at last that those fakers back in
            the 60's had slipped up, and I finally had the evidence in
            hand to out the whole fraudulent "moon landing" hoax as a
            public disgrace?&nbsp; Had I, indeed, finally slipped into
            madness or senility and needed to be carted away to an
            institution of some appropriate flavor where I would only be
            fed soft foods in perpetuity and given pills in little paper
            cups to be swallowed under the watchful eyes of white-coated
            people?<br>
            <br>
            Fortunately, no.&nbsp; I asked for help in resolving the
            problem, and as it often turns out in these situations, Mike
            Stewart (thanks, Mike!) happened to know something that I
            didn't know, namely that this circuit module, of which two
            are used in the Block I AGC, is plugged in <i>backwards</i>
            in slot B11, even though it is plugged in forwards in slot
            B10.&nbsp; Thus the pin numbering for module B11 is the
            opposite of that for module B10, even though the two are
            physically identical.&nbsp; This entirely resolves the
            paradox.<br>

            And that, children, is how my sanity, the integrity of the
            Project Apollo, and indeed the entire structure of
            spacetime, were saved on this day, the Nones of March, in
            the year of our Lord (or not, if you disagree) 2019!<br>

                circuit blocks have been "reannotated".&nbsp; The
                modules in question are basically all of the analog "B"
                modules (as opposed to the digital "A" modules).&nbsp;
                What this nonsense statement means is that the reference
                designators have been corrected to hopefully agree with
                those physically marked on the original modules, as
                opposed to using many reference designators arbitrarily
                assigned by the KiCad program.&nbsp; If that still
                sounds completely opaque ... well, it's something that's
                only really meaningful to someone working with actual
                AGC B-modules, and not useful to someone who simply
                wants to casually look through the schematics (which I
                expect is 99% of anybody interested in these CAD
                transcriptions of the original schematics at all), so I
                won't clutter up this space with further
                explanation.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that it's a fix for
                an inconsistency with respect to the original design
                that has been bugging <i>me</i> for months and months,
                so I'm glad that it has finally been taken care of.<br>

                idea in my head that I could extract the NOR-gate
                reference designators and input-pin assignments from the
                wiring diagram <i>in spite of</i> the fact that the
                drawing itself was illegible.&nbsp; And indeed, it
                turned to be <i>almost</i> possible to do that
                perfectly.&nbsp; In the end, it turned out that only two
                gates which were wired in parallel couldn't be
                distinguished from each other, so that for them I had
                two reference designators and two gates and didn't know
                which went with which.&nbsp; Hardly the worst problem
                one could have!&nbsp; In other words, overall the
                reverse-engineering of the wiring diagram worked out
                quite well.&nbsp; Pointless, I know, since it would seem
                so totally unnecessary to anyone not obsessed with
                authenticity, but weirdly satisfying in a
                digital-archaeology sense.&nbsp; <img src="smiley.png"

              can read the writeup about the discrepancies here</a>, if
            you like.&nbsp; This is actually a case where the
            availability of the official schematic doesn't necessarily
            obviate the need for the ND-1021041 schematic, because the
            latter contains a lot of information about backplane signals
            that the former does not.&nbsp; In fact, between the two, it
            contains <i>most</i> of the information on that
            topic.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Only the pages for AGC models <a href="1003700-051.html">1003700-051</a>
            and <a href="1003700-071.html">1003700-071</a> have been
            updated with this information, because we don't actually
            have the particular assembly drawings for the other Block I
            AGC models that would tell us that 1006540 is the proper
            schematic and 1006120 is the proper wiring diagram. <br>
            <br>
            By the way, this is the <i>last</i> of the schematics that
            I "recovered" from ND-1021041 prior to the availability of
            the true original Block I drawings, so I am now officially
            caught up and can begin transcribing schematics for Block I
            AGC/DSKY modules that haven't been dealt with yet.&nbsp; My
            final judgement on the schematics recovered from ND-1021041
            is that ND-1021041 has a lot of errors in it, particularly
            in so far as connector pins are concerned, so it's good
            thing we now have the original drawings.&nbsp; But in spite
            of that, ND-1021041 is almost always correct about
            everything else, and is a fantastic resource when working
            with this material.&nbsp; Furthermore, most of the
            connector-pin errors seemed to have been the result of
            accidentally occasionally using pin numbers from an earlier
            version of the device, which is probably not a problem that
            would occur with the analogous Block II document
            ND-1021042.&nbsp; Only a couple of things were uncovered
            that I interpreted as actual electrical <i>errors</i> in
            ND-1021041, though I had only recovered 7 modules, and 7
            modules do not an AGC make.&nbsp; So all in all, good job AC
            Electronics!<br>

              <li>Because of the WYSIWYG HTML editor I normally use on

                from time to time to keep this junk from proliferating
                too much.&nbsp; Which I've just done.&nbsp; The
                improvements in some file-sizes (particularly this
                change log page and the MIT/IL drawing-index page) are
                semi-dramatic.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the automated
                cleaner did mess up a couple of my tables ... all of
                which I hopefully found and fixed, though I guess it may
                take a while to be sure.<br>

              href="ElectroMechanical.html">the electro-mechanical page
              has been basically restructured from the ground up and
              rewritten to both be a tad simpler and at the same time to
              provide far more actual electro-mechanical information
              than before</a>.&nbsp; Instead of providing the electrical
            drawings for a half-dozen Block II AGC/DSKY models as
            before, it provides electro-mechanical drawing trees (i.e.,
            electrical <i>and</i> mechanical drawings) for 30 or so
            Block I and Block II AGC and DSKY models.&nbsp; And could be
            made to provide quite a few more, if there turns out to be
            any reason to do so.&nbsp; Admittedly, the drawing coverage
            is not perfect, since not only was NARA's coverage of the
            drawings a bit spotty, but also I had limited time to scan
            them ... and wasn't helped by the fact that the government
            (and consequently NARA) was shut down for the last
            week.&nbsp; Okay, nothing's perfect!&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Incomplete or not, the restructuring provides a much more
            useful and interesting view of the AGC/DSKY electrical and
            mechanical design than we had before.&nbsp; The
            electro-mechanical page is now a portal providing two main
            ways of browsing the set of available drawings:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>A flat view of the drawing set, ordered by drawing
                number and revision.</li>
              <li>A hierarchical view of the drawing set, ordered by
                G&amp;N (Guidance &amp; Navigation) system type ... or
                if you prefer to think of it that way, by Apollo mission
                number, or by AGC or DSKY part number.&nbsp; In this
                hierarchical view, you navigate through the drawings on
                an assembly-by-assembly basis for whatever G&amp;N
                system, mission number, or AGC/DSKY part number you feel
                like.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All other supplemental information provided by the
              electro-mechanical page is now subordinated to this basic
              drawing-browsing activity.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Some information that I deemed uninteresting and
              distracting was (gasp!) even removed from the page
              entirely, and <i>not</i> provided separately.&nbsp; I
              don't know that I've ever done anything like that
              before.&nbsp; It was only the table of serial numbers for
              AGCs and DSKYs that was removed, though, and I felt the
              information was buggy and too difficult to correct, so I
              don't actually think losing it is much of a loss at
              all.&nbsp; If anyone disagrees and thinks it was valuable
              in some way, drop me a line.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Now that the drawings are arranged in this fashion, I'll
              have to somewhat modify my prior claims that we now have
              all of the DSKY and AGC schematics.&nbsp; There are so
              many engineering drawings needed for any given model of
              AGC or DSKY that there's no single AGC or DSKY model for
              which we have anything like a full set of drawings.&nbsp;
              Naturally, I'd like to have a complete set, not just for
              some AGC/DSKY model, but for <i>all</i> of them.<br>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, all of the models are generally so
              similar — after all, all of the AGCs in either of the two
              "blocks" can run the same software as any of the others,
              mostly, so how different could they really be? — that
              there's a lot of mixing and matching among different unit
              types that you can do.&nbsp; In that sense, we have most
              of the drawings in so many different versions, you can
              almost always find <i>something</i> that will work for
              you if you don't have the specific drawing you want,
              either electrically or mechanically.&nbsp; In that sense,
              you could say we not only have have all of the drawings,
              but have them many times over.<br>
            </p>
            <p>What?&nbsp; You think that sounds specious?&nbsp; It's a
              glass-half-full glass-half-empty thing here, people, work
              with me to overlook the problems!&nbsp; <img
                src="smiley.png" alt="" height="16" width="16"><br>
            </p>
            <p>At any rate, over the course of 2019 I'll be working to
              fill in the gaps in the AGC/DSKY drawing-set as much as
              possible.&nbsp; There's also the possibility of extending
              it to other G&amp;N components such as the CDU, since NARA
              has drawings for basically all of the G&amp;N
              components.&nbsp; And I'll also return to transcribing the
              Block I schematics into CAD, which is what I was doing
              before I started spending every day over at NARA.&nbsp; It
              will be a lot easier now that I actually have <i>real</i>
              Block I drawings instead of having to "recover" schematics
              from the bits and pieces in AC Electronics document
              ND-1021041.&nbsp; It will be interesting to compare the
              real schematics (once they're in CAD) to the "recovered"
              ones I made before we discovered that the real drawings
              still exist.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, as usual, I'll note that since the changes to
              the electro-mechanical page are so sweeping, it's
              unavoidable that there are bugs in it, particularly in the
              new drawing trees.&nbsp; Hopefully we'll be able to clean
              those up in a timely fashion.<br>

            This section is now completely up-to-date with respect to

            that time and money pressure caused me to scan them in a
            really sleazy fashion, using a portable flatbed scanner,
            rather than the fancy NARA equipment, so the document scans
            are incredibly poor quality.&nbsp; The results are very
            uneven, with many pages having been digitized quite well,
            but with the majority having some blurry parts, and a few
            pages even being illegible.&nbsp; My excuse is that the
            scans are better than nothing, and you wouldn't have them at

                this week at NARA.&nbsp; There are over 4400 scans in
                all now.</li>
              <li> Various documents related to midcourse-correction
                processor for NASA's RTCC (Real Time Computer Complex)
                have been added to the Apollo 11, 13, 14, 15, and 16
                items in <a

                  document library's "miscellaneous mission documents"
                  section</a>.&nbsp; The full-quality scans are over at
                our Internet Archive site as well, though I'm going to
                stop providing explicit double-links (local low-quality
                plus Internet Archive high-quality).&nbsp; If you wonder
                whether a higher-quality version is available for some
                document or the other, just head over there and
                look.&nbsp; But as far as these particular documents are
                concerned, I'm told they're particularly valuable (for
                something relating to the RTCC rather than the AGC <img
                  src="smiley.png" alt="" height="16" width="16">)
                because they organize together in one place information
                that previously difficult to access because it was
                spread out over a number of hard-to-get memos.&nbsp;
                Check them out.&nbsp; From my perspective, the document
                on abort-plans for Apollo 11 seems particularly
                interesting.<br>

                with.&nbsp; For some insane reason I left these scans as
                TIFFs which, at least in my browser, you can't directly
                view.&nbsp; Similarly, a finding aid from NARA itself
                was left in a Microsoft Word format that's not useful in
                a web browser.&nbsp; At any rate, I've now converted
                these to PNGs and PDF, respectively, making them far
                more convenient for web purposes.</li>

                having been sold by the MSC employee who originally
                owned it.&nbsp; Which just goes to show that used-book

            <br>
            Kidding aside, though, the Instrumentation Lab Block I
            electrical drawings I alluded to yesterday have magically
            appeared overnight, and I've incorporated them into our
            electro-mechanical page.&nbsp; I'm missing a couple of DSKY
            drawings, so perhaps I messed up when I made my shopping
            list and will have to try again.&nbsp; At any rate, what has
            been added is a <i>complete</i> set of the official
            electrical schematics for the Block I AGC p/n 1003700, and
            mostly-complete sets (missing the keyboard module) for Block
            I nav &amp; main DSKYs 1003706 &amp; 1003707.&nbsp; You have
            to take that with a slight grain of salt, since most of the
            drawings are actually 1 or 2 revisions off from what we were
            looking for; but I'm not sure how much confidence we can
            have that the revisions we were looking for were necessarily
            the right ones anyway, so that doesn't sound like a great
            problem.&nbsp; Particularly not when the alternative
            situation (yesterday!) was that we had none of the Block I
            official drawings at all.&nbsp; In fact, whether or not we
            have the precise revisions we were targeting, we have lots
            and lots of revisions we weren't targeting.&nbsp; A typical
            example might be that we were targeting rev G of a drawing
            but only got revs -, A, ..., F.&nbsp; Lest you doubt my
            word, there are over 200 such drawing scans.<br>
            <br>

              files</a> and haven't bothered with the PNG files, for a
            reason which will become apparent in a moment.&nbsp; By the
            way, this particular drawing turned out to be a monstrous
            effort.&nbsp; It was split out into 23 separate figures in
            ND-1021041, but lots and lots of that was little duplicated
            blocks of circuitry (presumably for clarity), replete with
            errors in terms of connector pin numbering ... all of which
            had to be resolved.&nbsp; What fun!<br>
            <br>
            Besides not making the PNG files for this drawing, I'm also
            going to pause most of the effort of recovering the <i>rest</i>
            of the Block I schematics from AC Electronics document
            ND-1021041 for the moment.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, because of
            some crazy news I got today.&nbsp; As you know, we don't
            have the official drawings for the Block I schematics, and
            that's why I've been resorting to "recovering" them from the
            blocks of circuitry in ND-1021041's figures.&nbsp; That's
            obviously not 100% satisfactory (though it's infinitely
            better than having no schematics at all <img alt=""
              src="smiley.png" height="16" width="16">), because of the
            errors and omissions inherent in AC Electronics's redrafting
            of the drawings, the lack of versioning of the drawings
            obtained in this way, and the fact that the "recovered"
            drawings simply <i>look</i> nothing like the
            originals.&nbsp; But in theory, the recovery process should
            still produce a very close approximation of the original
            design, if AC Electronics didn't screw up too badly.<br>
            <br>
            Whatever.&nbsp; The crazy news from today is that it looks
            like there's a high probability of getting the official
            drawings themselves in the near future, for both the AGC and
            the main/nav DSKYs ... all except drawing 1006545 (AGC
            module A23).&nbsp; So I'll still recover that one from
            ND-1021041.<br>
            <br>
            Anyway, I don't want to say much more than that right now,
            since the Universe doesn't like that kind of thing and would
            probably try to queer the deal if I did. <img alt=""
              src="smiley.png" height="16" width="16">&nbsp; The
            transcriptions done so far won't be a total waste, of
            course, since if we do manage to get and transcribe the
            official drawings, when we can use the recovered drawings to
            do automated cross-checks of the netlists and
            what-not.&nbsp; Even so, the time spent on it is time I'm
            not going to be getting back, unless karma is a real thing.<br>

              <li>Drawing 1006543 has been recovered from

                module A17, and is a pot pourri of various stuff, with
                the largest contribution being parity logic.&nbsp; <a

                were lots of pin-numbering errors in ND-1021041, so I
                had to arbitrarily reassign various signals to
                otherwise-unused pins.&nbsp; That's a normal experience
                with these drawings, but there were quite a few more
                errors than usual, given the relative simplicity of this
                module's schematics.&nbsp; I hope the number of wiring
                errors doesn't turn out to be comparable!</li>

            ND-1021041 for 1006540 (AGC modules A1-A16, "logic flow

            (including parity) in the memory/register words, each using
            the same physical module, but different signals are input
            and output to each of them from the backplane.&nbsp; Plus, a
            number of internal signals are presented to the backplane
            and can be wired up differently there, creating circuits
            that are superficially somewhat different from what you'd
            naively expect from the drawing.&nbsp; So while the drawing

            went much better than yesterday's drawing, with no obvious
            errors in document ND-1021041.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            There <i>is</i> a problem with the Block I transcriptions
            that I forgot to mention yesterday, though, in that
            ND-1021041 doesn't always list backplane signal names in its
            schematics when the connectivity is obvious from the
            drawing, so if you have <i>just</i> the transcribed
            schematics, you can't deduce all of the backplane
            connections from it.&nbsp; I'm currently assigning those
            otherwise-unnamed connector pins with names like P<i>M_N</i>,
            where <i>M</i> is the module number and <i>N</i> is the
            pin number.&nbsp; I supplement that scheme by maintaining a
            connectivity database as I go along that tells which of the
            P<i>M_N</i> pins are connected to which other P<i>M_N</i>
            pins. &nbsp;&nbsp; For example, pins P33_65 and P33_77 in
            module A33 are connected to pin P34_53 via the backplane. <br>
            <br>
            Eventually I'll eliminate the P<i>M_N</i> names entirely, by
            assigning unique but logically-reasonable or arbitrary names
            to those as-yet-unnamed backplane nets.&nbsp; That's simply
            not too convenient at <i>this</i> stage.&nbsp; For now, for
            drawings I've already transcribed, the files <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/schematics/Scripts/pinsBlockI.txt">pinsBlockI.txt</a>
            and <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/schematics/Scripts/connectionsBlockI.txt">connectionsBlockI.txt</a>
            in our github repository can be used to get lists of block I
            backplane connector pin names and of backplane nets that
            aren't yet obvious from the pin names.&nbsp; Fortunately,
            there aren't too many of them, percentage-wise.<br>

          <td valign="top">I've "recovered" or "regenerated" my first
            first draft of a Block I AGC schematic drawing, namely
            drawing 1006547, "Logic Flow G", modules A33 and A34, which
            corresponds roughly to the Block II scaler module A1.&nbsp;
            By "recovery", I'm referring to the fact that we don't have
            a copy of any of the revisions of the official drawing
            1006547, but we do have AC Electronics document
            ND-1021041.&nbsp; ND-1021041 seemingly contains the entire
            Block I AGC schematics, but redrawn and grouped logically
            across a large set of Figures.&nbsp; For example, all of the
            schematics for drawing 1006747 seem to be in Figures 4-59,
            4-153, 4-165, and 4-181.<br>
            <br>
            There are pluses and minuses to this recovery process.&nbsp;
            For one thing, ND-1021041 is far more legible than any of
            our scans of the official AGC schematic drawings.&nbsp; On
            the other hand, though these schematics are functionally
            identical (hopefully!) they are by no means visually
            identical to the originals, so it still leaves us without a
            clue as to how the originals actually looked.&nbsp; Nor does
            ND-1021041 have any of the original notes from the drawings,
            nor the parts lists that usually appeared as tables in the
            originals.&nbsp; So I've eliminated certain visual conceits
            in my transcription, such as no longer adding
            Instrumentation Labs borders or title blocks to them.<br>
            <br>
            And frankly, if my experience so far is in any way
            representative, ND-1021041 introduced a lot of drafting
            errors that were not present in the original drawings.&nbsp;
            Consequently, these "first drafts" are more "drafty" than
            we're used to <img src="smiley.png" alt="" height="16"
              width="16">, and it will take longer to wring out the
            errors from them.&nbsp; Though once I've recovered enough of
            the logic modules to perform Verilog simulations of the
            logic — i.e., to run Block I software on the simulated
            electronics — we can obviously start to feel good about the
            process; but that's somewhere in the distant future right
            now.&nbsp; Fortunately, a lot of drawing 1006547 should be
            simulable in a stand-alone fashion, though I haven't done it
            just yet.<br>
            <br>
            With that said, I'm pretty pleased with this very first
            drawing.&nbsp; As usual, we have <a

            revisions of the schematic drawings, plus mechanical
            drawings.&nbsp; May take a while.<br>
            <br>
            In an unrelated development, the comments about the AGC's
            integrated-circuit usage on the electro-mechanical page have

            that many modules, with no obvious spaces where many more of
            them could be hidden from view.&nbsp; Well, it's now clear
            that 9 of the modules listed were only for the main DSKY
            (D4-6, 11-14, 16, 17), and other 9 were only for the NAV

                simulation.&nbsp; I'm tracking down those errors and

                can now actually fire up the full-AGC simulation with
                it.&nbsp; There's no erasable or fixed memory
                implemented yet, so all the simulation does is basically
                to jump to the start vector (address 4000 octal) ... at
                which point the "instructions" it starts fetching from
                the non-existent rope are nonsense.&nbsp; But still,
                just getting to this point is a pretty significant
                milestone.&nbsp; Of course, all I'm doing is lagging by

                  Stewart already has already had working</a>, albeit
                developed with somewhat different design criteria in
                mind, and therefore quite different in terms of details
                of the implementation.</li>
              <li>And speaking of Mike, you may recall that we've been
                getting a vast trove of documentation and software from
                Don Eyles the last couple of years, but that
                periodically we've mistakenly mentioned that Don's stash
                had finally been exhausted.&nbsp; What Don had forgotten
                to mention to us, though, is that Russ Larson's and
                George Silver's widows had turned over 6-7 boxes <i>each</i>
                of <i>their</i> papers, and that Don was mostly
                unfamiliar with the contents of those boxes.&nbsp; Mike
                immediately hopped on a plane and spent what I suspect
                was a subjectively <i>very long</i> long-weekend
                indexing those boxes, and then scanning a few items that
                seemed most-immediately pressing.&nbsp; The boxes
                contained nearly 800 items in total.&nbsp; As a result
                of Mike's lost weekend, there are 98 new items in <a
                  href="links.html">the document library</a> today, with
                (presumably) a lot more of the remaining ~700 items to
                come in the future as we work out the pragmatic details
                of how to accomplish that.&nbsp; Many thanks to all
                concerned!&nbsp; Here's an executive summary of the some
                of the more-significant items we've got so far, from my
                point of view. I think that overall it would be fair to
                say that there's an emphasis on AGC hardware vs software

                  of AGC module A1 (drawing 2005259A)</a> actually works
                and behaves identically with what ND-1021042 says it
                should.&nbsp; So as far as I can tell right now, that
                means that the CAD for module A1 is 100% correct.&nbsp;
                But I want to write that up in detail at some point,
                with pictures, and haven't done so yet.&nbsp; Plus, it
                still leaves us a pretty long way from running a full

                now all available), for AGC p/n 2003200.&nbsp; They've
                also undergone cross-checking and comparison against
                Mike Stewart's <a
                  href="http://apolloguidance.computer/pins">pin
                  database for the AGC backplane</a> (into which the

                Mike's earlier, independent transcription into CAD and
                subsequent hardware simulation, so I think we can start
                to have a little confidence in these new CAD
                transcriptions.&nbsp; (The reason for these new
                transcriptions is that Mike's earlier ones weren't
                intended to duplicate the visual appearance of the
                original schematics, nor to reflect versioning
                differences, but merely to relect the final version of
                the hardware as accurately as possible.)&nbsp;
                Roadmap-wise, this should be the minimal set of drawings
                needed for hardware simulation of the AGC logic (as
                opposed to its analog characteristics), so that is
                something I'm going to start thinking about seriously
                now, as well as transcription of all of the drawing
                versions that haven't been transcribed yet, extending to
                the later model 2003993, and the earlier model 2003100.</li>

            the drawings I've been adding so far, in the sense that
            those prior drawings all provided a "flat" design, whereas
            today's is purely hierarchical.&nbsp; In other words, even
            though the prior drawings may have consisted of two or three
            sheets sometimes, that was really only due to the fact that
            the design was simply too big to fit on a single page, so
            the designers split it up into more.&nbsp; If you had a big
            enough piece of paper, you could have stuck the stuff on all
            those sheets onto the one large page with no other
            change.&nbsp; With the interface module, however, the design
            uses 5 smaller subcircuits, represented by separate CAD
            files that appear over and over again in the main
            circuit.&nbsp; For example, the "P" subcircuit appears more
            than 10 times, while the "C" subcircuit is used over 30
            times.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that added complexity causes the
            CAD design to look not quite as similar to the original
            drawing, but it still is a pretty fair visual approximation.

            <br>
            If I haven't so commented before, I should mention that for
            these electrical schematics I've been prioritizing
            transcription speed — i.e., I'm trying to get a minimally
            complete set of schematics transcribed and online as soon as
            possible — relative to accuracy.&nbsp; So while I think the
            transcriptions are pretty accurate, and they do all pass
            KiCad's ERC (automated error check), there are undoubtedly
            errors in them that will only be caught in proofing directly
            against the scanned drawings.&nbsp; And I haven't done a lot
            of proofing on them.&nbsp; So, anyone who is interested in
            participating in such a proof-reading process, feel free to
            step forward.&nbsp; Fortunately, unlike the schematic entry
            process itself, it doesn't involve a lot (or any) knowledge
            of electronics or electronics design tools to do so, and is
            simply a matter of comparing two drawings
            side-by-side.&nbsp; For example, here are the original
            scanned drawing and the CAD-generated drawing for module A13
            (click to enlarge):<br>
            <br>
            <div align="center"><a

                  src="small-CAD-2005269--.png" alt="Click to enlarge"

            </div>
            <br>
            A good example of the <i>need</i> for proofing is the
            drawings for modules A8, A9, A10, and A11.&nbsp; These
            drawings are so similar to each other that only A8 was
            actually transcribed, while the drawings for A9-A11 were
            merely adapted from the drawings for A8.&nbsp; This sped
            things up a lot, sure, and it eliminated a lot of potential
            errors ... but it also <i>masked</i> various other types of
            potential errors by making it very hard for me to see
            them.&nbsp; Proofing will be so important!<br>
            <br>
            As far as the "minimally complete" set of drawings is
            concerned, I'm referring to AGC p/n 2003200-011 and DSKY p/n
            2003950-011, since this is the combination of units for
            which we can most-plausibly say that we have the exact
            revisions of all the drawings we need.&nbsp; Earlier and
            later AGC/DSKY part numbers will follow, and (I think) will
            all arguably be close enough to being complete drawing sets
            as desired for any <i>practical</i> purpose, but not in the
            mindlessly-obvious sense that 2003200/2003950 is
            complete.&nbsp; The reason my earlier comments (below) refer
            to all of the CAD drawings being added as the "flight
            version" even though they're for AGC 2003200 is that many of
            the drawing revisions for AGC 2003200 really <i>are</i>
            identical to the drawing revisions for AGC p/n 2003993 (the
            flown AGC p/n), and the ones added so far are among
            those.&nbsp; But eventually there will be some drawings
            added that are close to the flown revision without being
            100% identical to them.<br>

              <li>It turns out that in all of the drawings so-far
                converted from the AGC Handbook to CAD (namely, drawings
                2005902B, 2005903A, 2005952-, and 2005973r), I had
                misinterpreted what were supposed to be connector pins
                as global nets.&nbsp; Those have all now been
                fixed.&nbsp; These schematics now all pass KiCad's ERC
                (Electrical Rule Checker), with the happy side effect
                that a few connections which didn't quite "connect"
                before, due to wire endpoints being physically very
                close visually but not actually touching, have been
                fixed as well.&nbsp; None of this makes a significant <i>visual</i>
                difference in the images created from the CAD files —
                mainly, little rectangular boxes with numbers in them
                have been replaced by little ovals with the same numbers
                in them — but it's a world of difference electrically
                and in terms of confidence in the transcription.</li>

              href="ElectroMechanical.html">electro-mechanical page</a>,
            first mentioned a couple of days back, is a notebook called
            the AGC Handbook, given to us by Don Eyles.&nbsp; This is
            not so much a "document" as it is (or <i>was</i>) an
            evolving collection of electrical and mechanical drawings
            for the Block II AGC and DSKY.&nbsp; I'm not sure just how
            many drawings are in the book, but it has around 550 pages,
            and the drawings average around two pages each.&nbsp; So ...
            a <i>lot</i> of drawings.&nbsp; At any rate, Mike Stewart
            has finished scanning it, and we now have the complete thing
            online.&nbsp; In a slight variation from our usual practice,
            the document-library page of the website has been bypassed,
            so <a href="Documents/agc_handbook_jp2.pdf">a reduced-size
              (170MB) PDF appears on the electro-mechanical page</a>

            <br>
            It is known that there was a Block I AGC Handbook as well,
            and presumably later versions of the Block II AGC Handbook
            covering later versions of the AGC/DSKY, but we don't have
            any such handbooks.&nbsp; We never heard of them before Don
            Eyles broached the subject a couple of weeks ago, and so
            never even knew to look for them.&nbsp; If you know of any
            AGC Handbooks anywhere, please let us know, so that we can
            try to fill in the remaining gaps in our collection of

              <li>As students of AGC assembly language know, the AGC
                language is actually an intermixture of pure machine
                code (called "basic" instructions) and higher-level
                instructions ("interpretive" instructions) that are
                executed on a built-in interpreter which is itself is
                written in basic instructions.&nbsp; In an AGC program
                such as LUMINARY or COLOSSUS, a sequence of interpretive
                instructions is marked by the fact that it begins with
                the basic instruction <tt>TC INTPRET</tt> (to <i>start</i>
                a block of interpretive code) or <tt>TC DANZIG</tt> (to
                return to interpretive code from a basic-instruction
                subroutine called by interpretive code);&nbsp; other
                basic instructions precede the <tt>TC INTPRET/DANZIG</tt>,
                while interpretive instructions follow it.&nbsp; All
                very well and good ... but while INTPRET is clear, why<i><u>DANZIG</u></i>?&nbsp;

























































































































































































































































































































































                Danzig is obviously (or <i>was</i> obviously) the name
                of a city in Poland, but is that significant
                somehow?&nbsp; Since this is the kind of thing I worry
                about, I've wondered about it since the beginning of
                this project, about 15 years ago.&nbsp; But on that
                issue, today is the day to stop wondering! I now know
                why, and you can know why too, if you follow <a
                  href="assembly_language_manual.html#Danzig">this link

                AGC architecture, which he terms "Block III", might look
                like.&nbsp; Well his thinking on the subject, upon which
                he has been working with Bruno Muller, have advanced a
                lot in the couple of years since we last heard anything

              <li>On the AGC assembly-language page of this site, my
                intention was always to create a comprehensive manual
                for AGC assembly language.&nbsp; While this was <i>somewhat</i>
                successful for the AGC's so-called "basic" instructions,
                it turned out to be sadly completely inadequate for the
                AGC interpreter language, whose descriptive section was
                basically a promisory note for future content that I
                ended up never creating.&nbsp; In other words, if you
                wanted to read anything about the interpreter
                instructions, you couldn't read my lovely verbiage about
                it, but would pretty much have to fall back on the
                original Instrumentation Lab documents.&nbsp;

                left.&nbsp; He has written just such a guide for the

            Naturally, the content might have changed a little from 1966
            to 1972, but I don't think you're going to find a better
            discussion of the topic anywhere in our document library, or

            What's important is that these are basically "theory of

            that's just speculation at the moment, and so we may or may

                come again?&nbsp; At any rate, so-called comedy aside,
                back then I tended to put a little note next to each of
                the hyperlinks to show how many megabytes were in each
                document file.&nbsp; Well, times have changed, at least
                as far as download sizes are concerned, and those
                quaint, old notes warning you about 4MB or 5MB downloads
                now just seem silly now that many of our downloads are
                hundreds of megabytes.&nbsp; Besides, 90% of the newer
                additions to the library no longer had notations like

            was the first production, man-rated lunar module, and was
            used for testing purposes rather than flight.&nbsp; The

                previously had no final version of the descent
                procedures specific to Apollo 11, and the procedures in
                this document differ from those cobbled together from
                the closest alternatives (Apollo 12 procedures or
                preliminary Apollo 11 procedures).&nbsp; This
                information is necessary, for example, in making
                simulated Apollo 11 landings in NASSP that are faithful
                to the 1969 original landing.<br>

            software with versions in 4 different programming
            languages.&nbsp; As a part of this effort, large chunks (but

            ported to those 4 alternate languages, as well as being
            flowcharted and described in detail.&nbsp; Thus, though this

              DSKY with integrated Raspberry Pi running yaAGC</a> that
            I've mentioned obliquely a couple of times in the last few
            of days, I had been asked to provide some sort of a facility
            for playing back pre-scripted AGC output-channel commands
            ... i.e., for controlling the DSKY from a script rather than
            from yaAGC, for things such as museum exhibits.&nbsp; So I
            added a primitive recording and playback capability to that
            DSKY program, which is called <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/piPeripheral/piDSKY2.py">piDSKY2.py</a>,
            it being a Python 3 script rather than the classic yaDSKY
            program.&nbsp; Having done that, I began to wonder where the
            heck anyone would actually get a meaningful script to run on
            the thing, since what you'd really want is realistic data
            from an actual mission simulation, rather than something
            recorded while just playing around with yaAGC and a
            DSKY.&nbsp; <br>

            The answer to that, it seemed to me, was to see if NASSP
            could log data about AGC-to-DSKY output-channel transactions
            or if not, could someone add it for me?&nbsp; Well, Nik Beug
            was kind enough to not only pep up NASSP's logging
            capabilities to meet my needs, but also to send me the log
            for a sample mission segment, namely an Apollo 8
            launch.&nbsp; So with a slight amount of work throwing
            together a little <a

script

























































































































































































































































































































































              for converting Nik's NASSP log format</a> to the format I
            needed, I now had the ability to "play back" an Apollo 8
            launch on the 3D DSKY.&nbsp; Yay, and thanks Nik!&nbsp;
            Hopefully we'll have a lot more of these scripts in the
            future. <br>
            <br>
            Now, unfortunately, not everybody is going to be able to
            have one of the 3D-printed DSKYs, so my next thought was
            this:&nbsp; Why not modify yaDSKY2 so that it can play back
            these scripts?&nbsp; So ... now it can!&nbsp; The way it
            works is that if you click on yaDSKY2's PROG indicator lamp
            with a mouse, you get a file dialog that allows you to
            choose a canned script for playback.&nbsp; Naturally, I've
            added this to <a

              introductory list of various fun things you can do with a

            programs to do stuff the AGC was never intended to do.&nbsp;
            As if I could write anything "simple"!&nbsp; This is
            prompted by the introduction onto the market of functional
            3D-printed DSKY look-alikes with integrated Raspberry Pi
            computers running Virtual AGC.&nbsp; It should probably be
            called an <i>iDSKY</i>.&nbsp; With units such as that,
            there seems to be a lot more interest in having the DSKY do
            cute stuff that's not necessarily directly AGC related than
            there is in pepping up the pure software simulation.&nbsp;
            Probably because there's more of a motivation to get value
            for your dollar, since the physical devices are costly while
            the software simulation is entirely free.&nbsp; <i>My</i>
            take on that is that it's fine to subvert the normal
            functionality of the unit, but that it should be implemented
            by writing programs in AGC assembly language to do it!&nbsp;
            (Well, I have my ideas about it, and nobody is forced to
            agree with me.&nbsp; :-) )&nbsp; At any rate, this is my
            attempt to encourage that.&nbsp; The new page is nowhere
            close to being complete, but I think it has enough on it to
            be useful.<br>

              to our developer page of a Python 3 program</a> which can
            be used as the basis for quickly creating a simple,
            low-performance simulated peripheral device for use with
            yaAGC.&nbsp; Basically, it handles the details of connecting
            the peripheral to yaAGC and of parsing the information
            passed between them, leaving the developer with the task of
            determining what's supposed to happen to data to/from the
            AGC's input/output channels.&nbsp; The basic motivation is
            that this might be a good way to throw together physical
            implementations of AGC peripherals, without having to
            concern oneself with C++ or cross-platform graphical
            toolkits or other complicating factors, by embedding a
            Raspberry Pi in them, and running a variation of this Python
            3 script on the Pi.&nbsp; There's also a sample Python 3
            script that illustrates how to use this technique to create
            a (<i>very</i>) simple DSKY. <br>

                  in just 888 pages, describing all the Saturn launch
                  vehicles ... up through early 1964</a>.&nbsp; It is
                interesting to <i>me</i> primarily because it provides

                Saturn I and Saturn IB launch vehicles that preceded the
                Saturn V.&nbsp; The ASC-15, like the LVDC, was developed
                by IBM Federal Systems Division in Owego NY, but unlike
                the LVDC was a drum-memory computer rather than a
                ferrite-core-memory computer.&nbsp; I have briefly
                mentioned the ASC-15 on our LVDC page previously, but
                only as a guidance computer for the Titan II, since I
                had been unaware it was used on some Apollo launch
                vehicles.&nbsp; Regardless, the information in the
                newly-added memorandum is still quite meager, and I've
                not yet altered my comments about the ASC-15 on the LVDC

          <td valign="top">The good NASSP folks have been making an
            effort lately to get our AGS (abort computer) simulation
            integrated into NASSP, and into checking it out, which is
            great!&nbsp; What Ryan Callaway in particular found was that
            while a lot of stuff worked, a lot of stuff didn't work
            either.&nbsp; Mike Stewart jumped right in and managed to
            find a bug I had made in the AGS simulator, yaAGS.&nbsp; So
            Ryan now reports that it "looks like all phases of
            rendezvous work as advertised in lunar orbit. I used AGS
            calculations for every part and ags controlled burns as well
            with RR and PGNS as backup/basis of comparison" and "the AGS
            aborts the LM beautifully in both DPS and APS aborts".&nbsp;
            Which is not to say that yaAGS necessarily is 100% perfect
            now, but this one fix has improved its behavior
            tremendously.&nbsp; For now, you have to build the software
            from source if you want this fix, and it hasn't migrated
            into the installer packages for VirtualAGC yet.&nbsp; Great
            work, guys!<br>

            who was doing a project that involved the binary patterns
            used to encode characters, specifically in the word

            of these characters, easily recognizable by a 1960's
            engineer, would have been in the Apollo era?&nbsp; I told
            her to use EBCDIC encoding.&nbsp; Then, in a rare fit of
            humility, I passed the question along to Hugh Blair-Smith as
            well.&nbsp; Hugh also said that EBCDIC was the appropriate
            answer, but then speculated about a separate matter:&nbsp;
            Is it possible to actually display the word "APOLLO" (or
            more accurately, "APOLO") directly on the DSKY itself?&nbsp;
            As you may recall, the DSKY was used to display <i>only</i>
            numbers and blanks, but that doesn't mean it isn't possible
            for appropriate software to display other patterns as
            well.&nbsp; Alas! it turned out not to be possible; none of
            the characters A, P, or L can be displayed.&nbsp; In fact,
            we ended up tracing through the DSKY's electrical schematics

                including numerous statistics and graphs about
                development time-frames, number of changes in each of
                the flight versions of the code, etc.&nbsp; The
                "amazing" part is the description of the amount of
                AGC-software related material sent to the
                now-unfortunately acronymed ISIS over the years —
                magnetic tapes of software, 10,000+ records of
                individual software changes — along with the explanation

                of LUMINARY 99 flew in Apollo 11 ... was it LUMINARY 99
                Rev 1 as we've been claiming all these years, and as
                documentation suggests, or was it LUMINARY 99 Rev 2 as
                Jim Kernan (the original "rope mother" for the Apollo 11
                LM software) says?&nbsp; The hope was that AP11ROPE
                might help resolve this question, given that it was
                printed long after Apollo 11 (namely, in 1970) and
                purports to be the mission code.&nbsp; Thus if AP11ROPE
                were identical to <a

                  99 Rev 1 code</a> it would support the notion that Rev

                  LUMINARY 99 Rev 2 code</a> (or at least relevantly

                source-code identical; it appears to have been branched
                from LUMINARY 99 Rev 0 (not Rev 1) and then modified to
                bring it up to date with Rev 1, but not with identical
                program comments.&nbsp; That being the case, it doesn't
                really imply much about whether Rev 1 or Rev 2 was used
                in the actual mission.&nbsp; But it did turn out to be a
                nice, clean, easy-to-OCR scan, that should be very easy
                to use to route out lingering program-comment errors in
                our transcriptions.</li>

                by Linden Sims and Vipin Rathor, respectively.&nbsp;
                Thanks, guys!&nbsp; Recall that ZERLINA is an "offline
                development" program that had been maintained by Don
                Eyles for experimenting with different types of
                improvements or fixes to LM software, and that AP11ROPE
                is actually a different printed copy of (we believe) the
                Apollo 11 LUMINARY 99 program we've already had for the
                last 10 years.&nbsp; But we're not <i>quite</i> sure
                yet that AP11ROPE and LUMINARY 99 are exactly the
                same.&nbsp; So we're going to check that (of course!),
                as well as to use it to cross-check yet again the
                existing transcription of LUMINARY 99. But there's no
                need to do a full transcription of AP11ROPE, unless we
                find out it's actually different in some way.&nbsp; A
                transcription of the AP11ROPE octals will be done,
                though, as part of the cross-checking process.&nbsp;
                ZERLINA, of course, we <i>will</i> be fully
                transcribing to source code, as well as creating an
                executable binary of it for the AGC simulator, starting
                immediately!&nbsp; At any rate, as usual, the scans are
                available both in lower-resolution (smaller-size) JPG
                and in archival higher-resolution (larger size) JPEG
                2000; the Luminary page details all of this, naturally,

                has now been rolled over from April-or-later to
                June-or-later.</li>
              <li>A bug in the SUNBURST 37 octal listing (whose release
                was mentioned on 5-27, see below) has been fixed.&nbsp;
                This was a marvelous and instructive typo in that it was
                a <i>single-digit error</i> that nevertheless did <i>not</i>
                cause a checksum error at runtime.&nbsp; That's because
                of an ambiguity in the checksumming system built into
                the AGC code:&nbsp; the checksum of a memory bank must
                be equal to either the bank number or else the negative
                of the bank number.&nbsp; In this case, the error was in
                memory bank 1, and the single error (in which the octal
                was off by 2) flipped the bank checksum from +1 to
                -1.&nbsp; This is a very rare type of error, but it's
                unfortunate that the system had that ambiguity.</li>
              <li>And speaking of checksums, it turns out that over the
                course of time, the algorithm used by YUL to generate
                the memory-bank checksums changed slightly.&nbsp; Prior
                to SUNBURST 116, I'm told, only the positive memory-bank
                values were used, but after that it was not always
                possible to generate the positive memory-bank values,
                and thus checksums for negative memory-bank values were
                generated when required.&nbsp; yaYUL has thus been
                modified with an appropriate new command-line switch to
                enforce this difference, allowing the removal of an
                annoying workaround in AURORA 12.&nbsp; (The assembly of
                both AURORA 12 and SUNBURST 37 are affected by this; the
                older RETREAD 44 has no checksums anyway, and so is not
                affected.)</li>
              <li>And speaking of annoying workarounds, the annoying "<tt>SBANK=</tt>
                workaround" has finally been eliminated!&nbsp; One of my
                more-irritating failures in writing the yaYUL assembler
                originally is that I was unable to figure out the scheme
                used by YUL/GAP to generate the so-called "superbank"
                bits in various address-generating pseudo-ops; in cases
                where the values of the superbits were actually
                important to the execution of the program, the bits
                generated by yaYUL were fine, but where they did not
                affect the execution, they were often wrong, and thus
                the code generated by yaYUL did not match the octals
                generated by YUL or GAP in those cases unless a handful
                of extra <tt>SBANK=</tt> pseudo-ops that weren't
                originally present in the assembly language code were
                inserted into our source code.&nbsp; Personally, I
                simply threw up my hands in disgust with it, deciding to
                live with these extra <tt>SBANK=</tt> pseudo-ops, but
                over the years several people have worked on incremental
                fixes and removal of <tt>SBANK=</tt> pseudo-ops, never
                with full success.&nbsp; Certainly, getting the original
                source code for YUL helped out a lot.&nbsp; However,
                over the weekend, the problem seems to have been
                cracked, and the entire AGC code base, including all
                code versions that we have, now assembles to the proper
                octals, entirely without any extra <tt>SBANK=</tt>
                pseudo-ops at all.&nbsp; There seem to have been several
                insights that contributed to this breakthrough.&nbsp;
                Two stand out to my mind.&nbsp; One is that if you
                actually look at a page of an AGC program listing (say,
                <a href="ScansForConversion/Luminary210/0059.jpg">page
                  57 of LUMINARY 210</a>), you may notice (<i>I</i>
                never did!) that there's a mysterious notation like <tt>E<i>n</i>
                  S<i>m</i></tt>, under the page numbers in the upper
                right-hand corners of the pages.&nbsp; These turn out to
                be the memory-bank bits (including superbank
                assumptions) that YUL/GAP <i>thought</i> applied at
                that point; this observation gives a lot more visibility
                into what YUL is thinking at any given point.&nbsp; The
                other observation that stands out is that the
                assumptions made by YUL for these bank bits changed at
                some point (between SUNBURST 37 and 120), so that a
                slightly different rule (and a different yaYUL
                command-line switch) applies to earlier code versions
                than to later ones.&nbsp; Great work, guys!</li>
              <li>Not only that, but the transcription of SUNBURST 37
                source code is now complete, though I suppose I should
                admit that some of the comments in the code haven't been
                full proof-read for typos, so</li>

              <li>Niklas Beug has provided some fun information about
                flying simulated Apollo 5 and Apollo 14 missions, in
                spite of the fact that we don't presently have any (CM
                or LM) of the Apollo 14 software, and that while we have
                the Apollo 5 (LM) software we don't have the necessary

                developers have worked out tricks to create the pad
                loads for Apollo 5, and to modify the Apollo 15 CM and

              repo</a> and look at the instructions.<br>
            <br>
            As I mentioned in my note from a couple of days ago, instead
            of locally posting individual page images for SUNBURST 37 in
            reduced-quality JPG form, which is my normal practice for
            all other AGC versions, I had instead simply locally
            reposted the PDF from our Internet Archive collection,
            thinking that it was "good enough".&nbsp; In other word if
            you followed the links on <a
              href="Luminary.html#Sunburst37">our Luminary page</a>,
            you'd probably end up downloading this supposedly-fine PDF.
            Well it <i>wasn't</i> good enough, so ... my
            apologies!&nbsp; The PDF has weird artifacts in which some
            characters were frequently replaced by other characters,
            such as 'D' in place of 'O'.&nbsp; Whatever the reason for
            this weird effect, it's obviously intolerable, so if you
            follow through the links to our locally-posted
            reduced-quality images <i>now</i>, you'll now find
            individual JPG pages.&nbsp; The <i>high-quality</i> images
            in our Internet Archive collection don't have this strange
            problem, and so can be used without fear, but I definitely
            would not recommend using the PDF found there. <br>
            <br>
            As a corollary, we now realize that Emerson was wrong, and
            that a foolish consistency may <i>not</i> be the hobgoblin

            37 is now available, scanned for our Internet Archive

            <br>
            As you may recall, SUNBURST 37 (also known as SHEPATIN 0) is
            an early version of the SUNBURST program, never used for any
            mission, though SUNBURST 120 was used later in the LM's AGC
            in the Apollo 5 unmanned mission.&nbsp; Like RETREAD and
            AURORA, SHEPATIN is another "missing link" in the AGC
            software's evolutionary development.<br>
            <br>
            As usual, we'll be producing an octal file for this (so that
            SHEPATIN can be run in the AGC simulator) as well as
            source-code files (so that we can do nice searching on it,
            have syntax-highlighted listings, and so on), but that will
            be a process that takes a bit of time.&nbsp; Right now, all
            we have is the scanned pages.<br>

            I've departed from my usual practice of providing local
            low-resolution JPG page images here at our main website, and
            have instead chosen to use a PDF as the local "low quality,
            lower size" version of the scanned page images.&nbsp; (The
            PDF was good enough, and I didn't feel compulsive enough to

            source code and various other purposes, has been exhibiting
            some anomalous behavior that I hadn't noticed before.&nbsp;
            I think this may stem from the fact that in the VM releases
            I've made so far, a fairly old version of Midori is being
            used.&nbsp; While I'll obviously fix this in the <i>next</i>

            landing, but we didn't have a speculation about the Apollo

            come up with a pretty-convincing explanation, namely that
            the simulation was for investigating certain proposed
            changes to the landing code, and the fact that it used

                write it up and generate Windows and Raspberry Pi
                installers after I'm more comfortable with the changes.
                The main change relates to the fact that we've now got
                so many different AGC versions available that the app's
                main window had become too big to display screens
                smaller than about 1280×1024. For screens smaller than
                that, the app will now automatically change the format
                so as to make its main window a lot smaller.&nbsp; This
                works well for displays down to around 800×720 (if there
                is such a thing), but for anything smaller than that
                you'll still be out of luck.&nbsp; You do lose the
                capability of running your own "custom" AGC software
                from the smaller-screen version of the GUI.&nbsp; The
                changes are just to the VirtualAGC GUI, and not to any
                of the simulations, so there's still no guarantee that
                you can fit an entire simulation onto a smaller screen.<br>

            don't actually have any source code for Skylark so far, and
            since the "Programmed Guidance Equations" are a kind of
            pseudo-code description of the source code, I guess this is
            the next-best thing to having the Skylark program
            itself.&nbsp; At any rate, here's a direct link:<br>

            <ul>
              <li>AGC CPU-simulation features:&nbsp; As you may know,
                the AGC had the ability of being able to execute a
                different instruction (stored in the B/BRUPT registers)
                upon return from an interrupt-service routine (ISR) than
                was stored at the actual address at which execution
                resumed afterward.&nbsp; In other words an ISR could
                load the binary value of the instruction it wanted
                executed upon return into the BRUPT register, and even
                though the RESUME instruction would cause the program
                counter to be loaded correctly, the binary instruction
                in BRUPT would be executed, irrespective of the value
                stored at the RESUME'd program-counter address.&nbsp;
                This was originally not a "feature", but was simply a
                consequence of the fact that the next instruction to be
                executed is always decoded by the AGC during the
                execution of the <i>preceding</i> instruction, and thus
                the decoded next instruction needed to be stored
                somewhere during an ISR, and subsequently restored after
                the ISR had been completed.&nbsp; Considered as a
                "feature", this is rather useless for ISRs, since all it
                can really do is crash the program or do something else
                that's unpleasant, but <i>could</i> be useful for
                something like a software-controlled interrupt, such as
                the EDRUPT instruction.&nbsp; The EDRUPT instruction,
                seemingly created for Ed Smalley's AGC self-test code,
                though possibly never used by him at all, was not
                something that was really needed for anything, but was
                instead created (as Hugh Blair-Smith has said) "because
                he could".&nbsp; At any rate, while I originally
                intended to implement this same behavior in the AGC CPU
                simulator, it caused difficulties for me ... and since
                it didn't seem to be used anywhere in the Luminary 131
                AGC code I originally worked with, I simply disabled the
                feature entirely rather than try to figure out how it
                was misbehaving.&nbsp; In other words, for all these
                years, yaAGC has simply been ignoring whatever is in the
                B/BRUPT registers.&nbsp; At any rate, Mike Stewart, in
                his unswerving quest to make yaAGC work <i>correctly</i>
                as opposed to well-enough, and to agree in its behavior
                with the Block II hardware simulation, has now debugged
                this behavior and fully restored B/BRUPT/EDRUPT.&nbsp;
                All known self-test software related to this behavior
                works correctly, yaAGC does agree with the hardware
                simulation, and the restored code has been tested
                multiple times in the NASSP Command Module and Lunar
                Module simulations.&nbsp; In short, B/BRUPT and EDRUPT
                are back, baby!&nbsp; Many thanks to Mike Stewart and
                the NASSP gang.</li>

              <ul>
                <li>Updated the VirtualAGC installer (again!), not only
                  for Ubuntu (for the VirtualAGC VM), but also for
                  Raspberry Pi.</li>
                <li>We once again have an installer for Windows as
                  well.&nbsp; I discontinued this some time ago because
                  it was such a hassle for me to maintain, but it's back
                  ... at least for now.&nbsp; As far as the Mac is
                  concerned, well that's still too, too much for me to
                  keep up with, so the installer for that is still
                  discontinued, and not likely to be reinstated.<br>
                </li>
                <li>Updated the VirtualAGC VM, which is really what I'd
                  prefer the casual user to use.&nbsp; While for the
                  most part the old VM could simply be updated with the
                  Ubuntu VirtualAGC installer mentioned above, there are
                  a number of other niceties I've changed, and not
                  handled by the installer, such as:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Added Code::Blocks visual-debugging links to the
                    desktop for many more AGC versions.</li>
                  <li>Eliminated the password entry associated with the
                    screen-saver, which I hadn't realized was enabled.</li>
                  <li>Replaced of the Firefox web-browser by the Midori
                    web-browser.&nbsp; While I don't expect anybody to
                    really be web-browsing from the VirtualAGC VM, the
                    web-browser is used by VirtualAGC for presenting the
                    AGC source code, and Midori is insanely faster than
                    Firefox at doing this, as well as being less
                    memory-hungry and disk-space hungry.&nbsp; So using
                    Midori is a win-win-win.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>It is perhaps notable that the use of installer
                  programs as such for the VirtualAGC package has now
                  been discontinued, and what I'm calling "installers"
                  are really just compressed archives of type "tar.xz",
                  which the user must manually uncompress.&nbsp; There
                  is some slight loss of ease for the user, in that
                  desktop icons and start-menu entries are no longer
                  created automatically.&nbsp; But there are compelling
                  reasons behind this move.&nbsp; The principal
                  motivation is that a tar.xy archive tends to be about
                  half the size of one of the old installer programs
                  (currently 20MB vs 40MB), <i>and</i> it's much easier
                  from a system-maintenance standpoint as well.&nbsp;
                  Thus, updating the "installers" more often becomes a
                  more-attractive proposition.<br>

                Most of these are more from a desire to avoid the

                associated with NTRS, rather than being of tremendous
                individual significance (as far as we know!) right now,

              <li>I've noticed for some time that there's a problem when
                I add lots of documents to the document library, because
                there's really no way to tell at a glance what has been
                added recently, and what has been there for a long
                time.&nbsp; I'm trying out adding an icon <img
                  src="new.png" alt=""> next to recent additions to the
                document library, with a notation at the top of the
                document library page telling what time-frame the icon
                is associated with.&nbsp; Right now, for example,
                everything added in March of this month (or presumably
                later if there is a later) is marked.&nbsp; We'll see
                how well it works.&nbsp; I've seen all too many sites
                where once something gets marked as "new", it may
                continue to be marked as "new" for years and years ...
                and obviously, that's not very helpful.&nbsp; At any
                rate, this only applies to the document library page,
                and not to the website in general.<br>

                could be used to track all AGC software changes, so that
                we could get a much-better understanding of the changes
                from (say) Luminary 99 to Luminary 116 to Luminary 131
                to whatever.&nbsp; Of course, the LUMINARY Memos aren't
                entirely complete, either in their coverage of events,
                nor in our collection of them.&nbsp; Well, the SCB Notes
                have a similar virtue, again if complete, in that they
                provide much the same information about software
                changes.&nbsp; Moreover, since in theory <i>every</i>
                software change had to be approved by the SCB, there
                shouldn't be as much of a completeness problem in the
                notes themselves, though obviously we have every bit as
                much of a problem in the completeness of our collection
                of them.&nbsp; In the case of SCB notes, though, they
                don't track changes like Luminary 99 → 100, but rather
                changes like Luminary 1B → 1C.&nbsp; This still ends up
                giving us the mission-to-mission changes, even if not
                the fine-grained revision-to-revision changes.<br>

              <li>It has been pointed out to me that the document
                library contained a few of the missions' technical crew
                debriefings, but that several more were missing though
                available elsewhere.&nbsp; So for the sake of
                consistency, the Apollo 12, 13, 14, and 16 technical
                crew debriefings have been copied from the <a

                  Surface Journal (ALSJ)</a> into <a

              <li>Corrected a few hyperlinks which pointed to files on

                D'oh!&nbsp; If only I had a dollar for every time I had
                had to fix that over the years.</li>
              <li>The recent Users' Guide documents from Don Eyles,
                mentioned over the last couple of updates, turn out to
                have a handful of foldout pages which were getting
                messed up in the conversion of the document to
                PDF.&nbsp; It has taken me several tries to get right
                (the problem being, apparently, that pages with aspect
                ratios more-extreme than 2:1 don't work right in the
                PDF), but I now have PDFs that I think are fully
                working.&nbsp; The fix to the PDFs has messed up those
                pages in the online viewer in our Internet Archive
                collection (sigh!), but the foldouts still legible
                there, and I'm willing to live with that.</li>
              <li>I've been chided for making it appear that the
                recently-added Programmed Guidance Equation documents
                from Don Eyles, for Luminary 1B and 1C, mentioned a few
                days ago, weren't very useful.&nbsp; That's a fair
                criticism, so I've modified my comments.&nbsp; While it
                is true that I think calling these documents the
                "Guidance Equations" is misleading, it would also be
                true that better titles for them would be "Pseudo-Code
                Descriptions of Luminary 1B" and "... 1C".&nbsp; And
                that, of course, can make them <i>very</i> valuable for
                someone trying to comprehend the Luminary 1B and 1C
                programs.&nbsp; As Don said when he gave them to me,
                "Now, you know, <i>we</i> [AGC developers] didn't ever
                use these documents; they were written afterward for <i>other</i>
                people" (or words to that effect, anyway).&nbsp; But <i>we</i>
                are the "other people" in this little scenario, so while
                these documents may not be so important for Don, they
                may indeed be very important for us.<br>

                  Strapdown Computations</a>".&nbsp; While I had scanned
                the darn thing at the time, and uploaded the
                archival-quality scans to our Internet Archive
                collection, I had failed to replace the old, bad version
                in our document library.&nbsp; D'oh!&nbsp; Well, I've
                done it now.&nbsp; It's an interesting concept that
                never made it into an actual spacecraft, but well-worth
                reading about.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Niklas Beug has made another video to supplement his
                previous Apollo 11 lunar landing simulation video (using
                Orbiter/NASSP/VirtualAGC/Luminary99), namely an Apollo
                15 simulated lunar landing (using
                Orbiter/NASSP/VirtualAGC/Luminary210), and I've linked
                it at a couple of a strategic locations.&nbsp; Here's <a
                  href="https://youtu.be/E301HplyA7A">a direct link to
                  YouTube</a>.&nbsp; For my taste, it's a lot more
                exciting than the Apollo 11 landing (minus the 1201/1202
                alarms and the boulder field at the very end of the
                Apollo 11 landing, of course), since you get to swoop in
                over the mountains; Nik indicates it's his favorite
                landing site as well.&nbsp; As far as it being a
                favorite landing site is concerned: I don't know if it
                depicts a real event or not, but the Apollo 15 episode
                of <i>From the Earth to the Moon</i> dramatizes Dave
                Scott as arguing for this Hadley-Apennine site (vs a
                "safer" landing site) in the decisive site-selection
                meeting, presenting the argument that it's worthwhile
                exploring beautiful places.</li>
              <li>I've done a lot of cross-version checking of our AGC
                source code (Luminary 69 vs Luminary 99 vs Luminary 116
                vs Luminary 131 vs Luminary 210; Colossus 237 vs
                Colossus 249 vs Comanche 55 vs Artemis 72; and Luminary
                99 vs Comanche 55), which has not only found various
                lingering errors (mostly look-alikes such as '0'⇆'O',
                '1'⇆'I', '.'⇆',', and so on), but more-importantly,
                insures consistency across AGC versions, hence reducing
                spurious "changes" for anybody who is interested in
                detailed tracking of changes from one AGC version to the
                next.&nbsp; Consequently, I've updated <a

                the Internet Archive a week or so to process them all,
                and it is only after they've done so that we'll have
                nice, compact PDFs with text-search, that can be

                  really describe this as "guidance equations".&nbsp;
                  The document itself says it should be used in

                  this case, Apollo 12 Lunar Module, and specifically
                  Luminary 116), and my characterization of it is that
                  it is a more-detailed, mostly-textual description of
                  the various objects (specifically variables) appearing
                  in the software than can be found in the program
                  comments themselves.&nbsp; In other words, it doesn't
                  superficially appear to have much to do with "guidance
                  equations", though admittedly it has &gt;1000 pages,

          <td valign="top">Lately, there has been some confusion as to
            whether the Luminary 99 source code we have been providing
            is actually the code that flew in the Apollo 11 LM or not,
            due to AGC developer Jim Kernan's recollections that there
            are three different revisions of that particular code
            (Luminary 99, Luminary 99 Rev 1, and Luminary 99 Rev 2), and
            the only version we actually have is Luminary 99 Rev
            1.&nbsp; Well, on the balance of the surviving evidence,
            what we currently believe is that Luminary 99 Rev 1 did
            indeed fly in Apollo 11, but also that Jim's recollection is
            correct and that there's a Rev 2 that is "better" in a
            certain way, but which didn't fly.&nbsp; But we have no
            physical printout for Rev 2.<br>
            <br>
            The explanation is that the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris">ephemeris</a>
            data in Rev 1 is wrong, but not <i>very</i> wrong, and
            certainly good enough for a lunar landing.&nbsp;
            Nevertheless, we know what the correct ephemeris should be,
            because it's identical to Apollo 12 and 13, so to celebrate
            that fact, we've artificially <i>recreated</i> <a
              href="listings/LUM99R2/MAIN.agc.html">Luminary 99 Rev 2</a>
            for you, as a mashup of 99 Rev 1 and Luminary 116, and we
            provide <i>both</i> Rev 1 and Rev 2 for you.&nbsp; You can
            view the source code or simulate either one to your heart's
            content.&nbsp; You can take your pick.&nbsp; It's called
            "choice", friends!&nbsp; We've named Luminary 99 Rev 2 <a

              the GitHub source tree</a>, because that's what Jim's
            story says he called it, way-back-when.<br>
            <br>
            We have also received new information about where a program
            listing for Comanche 44 exists.&nbsp; Comanche 44 did not
            fly on a mission, but Comanche 45 Rev. 2 (which is 2 months
            younger) flew in the Apollo 10 command module, so if we can
            get our hands on Comanche 44 some day, it may be the closest
            thing we'll ever have to Apollo 10 Command Module
            software.&nbsp; At any rate, the Colossus page has been
            updated with this info.<br>

                urge to double-check it.&nbsp; The comments in the
                source code undoubtedly still have quite a few errors,
                but after the transcription effort for Luminary 116 has
                been completed, I intend to do a 3-way check of it vs
                Luminary 99 and 131, which should eliminate quite a few
                of the remaining errors.&nbsp; This actually means that
                all of the fully-transcribed AGC source-code versions
                have now been completely proofed in their comment text,
                albeit not all to the same standards, due to differences
                in printout- and scan-quality.</li>
              <li>As usual, the proofing of Luminary 131's comments
                revealed various corresponding errors in the source code
                for other AGC versions, and those errors have been fixed
                as well.&nbsp; Consequently, there have been quite a few
                updates (not the least of which is Luminary 131 itself)
                in <a href="listings/">the colorized,

                time, which had fairly-important design consequences, so

                and demonstrates.&nbsp; The document in question, an

                time, this is naturally a huge help.</li>
              <li>There are a number of memos that give us more insight
                into what Zerlina is doing, and how.&nbsp; You may
                recall that Zerlina was an experimental program,
                branched from Luminary, and used to experiment with a
                number of new approaches.&nbsp; Furthermore, we will be
                obtaining Zerlina within the next few months, and going
                through our usual process of transcribing it into source
                code and running it in the AGC simulator.&nbsp; So it's
                nice to have some idea of what we can expect it to be
                doing.<br>

                to that&nbsp; (Artemis 72, Colossus 237, Colossus 249,
                Comanche 55, Luminary 99, Solarium 55).&nbsp; For <i>those</i>
                AGC scans, we've been hosting <i>just</i> the
                low-resolution imagery.&nbsp; The higher-resolution raw
                data from the scans has existed only on my own personal
                computers and backups, though you could have gotten it
                from me if you asked for it.&nbsp; Well, that situation
                has changed, and I've now uploaded all of the raw scan
                data to our Internet Archive collection.&nbsp; Now, I'll
                have to admit that, archival format or not, the visual
                quality is still rotten in comparison to the new scans,
                because I didn't understand things like white-balance
                settings when I took the pictures.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
                all of you (rather than I alone) now have access to the
                best-quality imagery available.&nbsp; Furthermore, in
                the future, I'll also be doing the same with any image
                files sent to me or that I personally scan.
                Incidentally, since AGC listings are <i>big</i>
                documents in comparison to what the Internet Archive
                normally handles, the initial processing on them may not
                yet be complete on all of these uploads if you rush over
                there right this instant to look at them; if the initial
                processing isn't complete, only the actually-uploaded
                data (gigantic PDFs 250MB-1.5GB in size) will be
                immediately accessible.&nbsp; After the processing is
                completed, you also have a convenient online flipbook
                viewing interface, a zipfile of JPEG2000 page images,
                and a more-compact PDF with searchable text.&nbsp;
                Solarium 55 is definitely ready for viewing at the
                moment I'm writing this, and the others should gradually
                become available over the next few days.&nbsp; Documents
                I end up scanning but which turn out not to be suitable
                for Virtual AGC proper, will simply remain in the
                Internet Archive collection; for example, you'll find <a
                  href="https://archive.org/details/MSC07857">a Shuttle
                  document</a> there that I happened to scan while
                scanning some AGC-related documents.</li>
              <li>I've also been busily correcting all of the metadata
                for the scans hosted in our Internet Archive collection,
                since we hadn't initially provided very good data at the
                time archive.org was making the scans.</li>
              <li>Three new documents pertaining to Apollo 4, 5, and 6
                have been contributed by AGC developer Jay
                Sampson.&nbsp; (Refer to the Sunburst 120 section of the
                Luminary page, and the Solarium 54 and 55 sections of
                the Colossus page.)</li>
              <li>Original AGC developer Jay Sampson has convinced us
                that the AGC versions used for these two missions
                (Solarium 54 and 55, respectively) are in fact <i>identical</i>
                though assigned different build numbers.&nbsp; In other
                words, we in fact have the AGC source code for Apollo 4,
                even though we didn't know we had it.&nbsp; I won't
                proclaim that discovery in a big box just yet,
                though!&nbsp; You can read the explanation in <a
                  href="Colossus.html#Solarium54">the Solarium 54 entry
                  on the Colossus page</a>.</li>
              <li>Original AGC developer Peter Volante has sent me a
                variety of organization charts for the Instrumentation
                Lab's Apollo development, which help to show how the
                organization evolved over time, and how the people
                within it moved around.&nbsp; I've added them as
                complementary to the list of developers gleaned from the
                AGC source code, in <a

              <li>I forgot to mention it, but proof-reading the program
                comments in Artemis 72 (Apollo 15-17 LM) has now been
                completed, and the improved source-code files have been
                available in our GitHub repo for a few days.&nbsp; The
                quality of the scan or the printout from which the scan
                was made was pretty poor, though, so there are likely to
                be more errors remaining than in many of the other AGC
                versions.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there's a great
                improvement.</li>
              <li>We have had Luminary 131 (Apollo 13 LM software)
                scanned from a copy in Don Eyles's possession.&nbsp;
                Old-timers here may recall that the availability of a
                Luminary 131 scan was what enabled this entire Virtual
                AGC project in the first place, back in the day, and
                without it, none of this mighty empire of AGCosity would
                exist at all.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there's no getting
                around the fact that that original scan was miserable in
                quality, barely legible, and practically a study of how
                a scan of a color document shouldn't be.&nbsp; In fact,
                many of the errors in AGC program comments I mentioned
                above, and have been mentioning for the last several
                months, stemmed originally from that very unreadability,
                but the new scan will now be used to finally eliminate
                those errors from our Luminary 131 source-code
                files.&nbsp; So we're lucky that we now have a really
                great scan.&nbsp; Check it out in our <a

            the 1971 simulation of the Apollo 11 landing leaves somewhat

            it's just too light for comfortable reading, because the

                misrepresented, but presumably this will be fixed
                soon.&nbsp; The scans are also very low-contrast and

                rather than the MIT Instrumentation Lab has

                almost but not quite impossible to find.&nbsp; But
                better late than never!)&nbsp; We've dubbed this program
                "Super Job" because of the markings on it, though it's
                hard to believe that Raytheon actually called it

          <td valign="top">As you may have seen in the notes made here
            over the last few months, I have been in the process of
            proofing and correcting the comment text in the various
            source-code transcriptions we have made of the AGC program
            listings available to us.&nbsp; Hitherto, we had no
            efficient way to do this, but had developed a tool for doing
            so that worked quite well on most of the of program
            listings, with newer scans tending to work much better than
            older ones ... hence in doing this proofing, I found myself
            working backward in time, progressing from the latest AGC
            scans to the earliest, finally reaching the <i>original</i>
            scans with which the Virtual AGC project started, namely
            Colossus 249 (Apollo 9 CM) and Luminary 131 (Apollo 13 LM),
            as well as the somewhat-later Artemis 72.&nbsp; The scans
            (or the associated printouts from which the scans were made,
            or the destructive OCR processing done on them) for Colossus
            249 and Luminary 131 are <i>so</i> bad that the "efficient"
            proofing tool cannot be applied at all, while Artemis 72 is
            highly questionable.&nbsp; Thus, a different and more
            time-consuming proofing process was required.<br>
            <br>
            I have just completed proofing Colossus 249, and the results
            are available in GitHub now.&nbsp; What has been done with
            it is to note that Colossus 237 (which preceded it
            chronologically by a short time), and Comanche 55 (which
            followed it chronologically) had already been proofed using
            the "efficient tool".&nbsp; A 3-way side-by-side "diff"
            between the transcribed source code from these three AGC
            program versions was done.&nbsp; This highlighted places
            where errors (many, many errors) <i>might</i> exist.&nbsp;
            An extremely-large number of errors was corrected in
            Colossus 249 in this way, along with a (much smaller) number
            of errors that lingered in the already-proofed&nbsp;
            Colossus 237 and Comanche 55.<br>
            <br>
            This proofing process also benefited from the availability
            of an alternate scan of Colossus 249, not available
            originally, but available nowadays from the collection of
            AGC developer Fred Martin.&nbsp; Thus, many parts of the
            original scan that were garbled to the point of
            illegibility, could now be filled in with absolute
            certainty.<br>
            <br>
            More than you wanted to know, probably, but having just
            finished it, I'm still excited about it!&nbsp;
            :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            A similar 3-way proofing of Luminary 131's comment text
            awaits availability of comment-proofed source-code Luminary
            116 and Zerlina (derived from Luminary 145), neither of
            which is available now, but both of which are expected to be
            available within a few months.&nbsp; Unfortunately, for
            Artemis 72, the <i>last</i> Colossus version, there is no
            prospect of a 3-way diff with predecessor and successor
            versions, but merely a 2-way diff against a predecessor
            version that may not be a closely-related as we would hope,
            so it will probably come last of all.&nbsp; But we'll see
            what we'll see.<br>

            This is equivalent to being in the Public Domain in the
            U.S., and is the closest equivalent to that in parts of the
            world where the concept of the public domain is not
            recognized.&nbsp; I learned this from something Nina Paley
            wrote in connection to her marvelous animated film, <a
              href="http://www.sitasingstheblues.com/">Sita Sings the
              Blues</a> ... which, if you've not seen it, you
            should!&nbsp; She had originally released it for free under
            the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike License, which
            already was unbelievably brave, but still had the effect of
            reserving some legal rights for herself.&nbsp; But she later
            concluded that since she knew she wasn't going to sue
            anybody for breaching the license anyway, what was the point
            of reserving any rights?&nbsp; So she simply changed the
            licensing in the same manner I am doing now.&nbsp; (Of
            course, I don't claim to have to have the guts she does,
            since I derived no financial benefit from this website
            anyway, so the licensing is irrelevant to my checkbook.)<br>

                  AGC program listings</a>: i.e., it now consists
                entirely of PNG files, one per each page numbered by the
                original assembler, and no PDF files at all.&nbsp; A
                side benefit is that while the original print/scan
                quality has naturally not improved, the quality of the
                images we're providing has nevertheless improved anyway,
                whilst decreasing the actual file sizes.&nbsp; At the
                same time, page-number references in the <a

                from the now-defunct History of Recent Technology
                website, have been changed so that (like all other AGC
                source-code listings) they correspond to the page
                markings on the original printed pages of the program
                listings.&nbsp; My motivation for all of these changes
                is that I intend to begin proofing the comment text in
                the Colossus 249 and Luminary 131 source-code files by
                cross-comparing them with similar AGC versions like
                Colossus 237, Comanche 55, and Luminary 99; that kind of
                cross-checkout would have been greatly hampered without
                the changes.&nbsp; Moreover, if we manage to get Don

                checking that that scan would enable would also have
                been hampered.&nbsp; However, even without such
                motivations, the overall effect of the changes is still
                to make the Colossus 249 and Luminary 131 material
                better and more accessible.</li>
              <li>I guess I've forgotten to mention <i>any</i> of the
                newspaper, magazine, or online articles in 2016 in which
                our Virtual AGC project played an important role.&nbsp;
                Of course, I don't necessarily know about all of them,
                since I don't spend a lot of time scouring the web for
                news about the project or about myself.&nbsp; The
                best-known is probably the article titled <a
href="https://qz.com/726338/the-code-that-took-america-to-the-moon-was-just-published-to-github-and-its-like-a-1960s-time-capsule/">"BURN,

























































































































































































































































































































































                  BABY! BURN! The code that took America to the moon was
                  just published to GitHub, and it’s like a 1960s time
                  capsule"</a> at Quartz.&nbsp; That one was fun for me,
                because various people stopped me or telephoned me to
                say "hey, is that you?"&nbsp; But for my taste, the
                article which has just appeared in the current issue of
                the U.K.'s <a href="http://www.slow-journalism.com/">Delayed

























































































































































































































































































































































                  Gratification magazine</a>, called "Houston, we have a
                program", is a lot more fun, for a number of
                reasons.&nbsp; Not least is that the article is really
                about our Virtual AGC project, rather than being
                primarily about Apollo 11 or the AGC software for Apollo
                11.&nbsp; But also, I think the article is extremely
                well-structured and entertaining, much more so than the
                endless, detailed blathering I output by the ton here at
                our website, so it's a fun read.&nbsp; I congratulate
                the writer, Chris Bourn, for the care he took, and the
                results he achieved.&nbsp; You may notice I've provided
                no link to the article, though.&nbsp; That's because
                Delayed Gratification is a print-only magazine,
                supported by subscribers rather than ads.&nbsp; They
                only put a handful of sample articles online; perhaps
                ours will some day be one of those (I hope!), but
                perhaps not.&nbsp; The magazine itself has a very
                intriguing concept: it is a proponent of something
                called "slow journalism", which is basically a throwback
                to the old days when journalists were supposed to do
                thorough fact checking, editors were supposed to edit,
                and so on, as opposed to today's situation, in which
                articles are thrown together as quickly as possible
                (probably by cutting-and-pasting unsubstantiated
                material), in order to maximize online ad revenue.&nbsp;
                In contrast, Delayed Gratification boasts that it is the
                <i>last</i> to break a story, rather than the <i>first</i>
                to do so. There's also an interesting TED talk about the
                concept of slow journalism:</li>

                Luminary 99 (Apollo 11 LM software) was actually missing
                almost an entire page (bottom of p. 1472 and top of p.
                1473).&nbsp; Of course, we had immediately
                reverse-engineered this when we were transcribing the
                source code, and knew that our reconstruction assembled
                to the correct octal values, but it would still be nice
                to have the "correct" version.&nbsp; Fortunately, Don
                Eyles was able to supply snapshots (now on <a
                  href="Luminary.html">the Luminary page</a>) from his
                own printout.&nbsp; Gratifyingly, though not
                surprisingly, the reconstruction was 100% accurate,
                including the comments.&nbsp; (Actually, there was a
                typo in the comments, but ignore that; it was 100%

                relationships amongst the various AGC programs were
                covered ... but only up to Apollo 11.&nbsp; I've taken
                it upon myself to recreate that diagram, and extend it
                all the way to the end of Apollo, by which I mean
                Apollo-Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz.&nbsp; It's a rather
                impressive picture, including even the science-project
                ZERLINA program, which was outside the main
                developmental flow; though even then, I'm told there
                were many other such separate programs, such as
                DIANA&nbsp; (about which I have a little info but not
                enough to include it in the chart), AMELIA, and so on.</li>

                undergone this correction process.)&nbsp; Because so

                the use of embedded checksums, and hence we cannot <i>yet</i>
                be as certain about the correctness as we normally would
                be at this point in the process, so I won't dignify this

                <li>While in the past (and continuing into the future!),
                  we've taken great pains to insure that the functional
                  source code and executable versions of the AGC program
                  versions we present here are 100% accurate, we've had
                  no tools at our disposal and much less luck at
                  insuring that the <i>comments</i> in these programs
                  are accurate transcriptions from the original.&nbsp;
                  This situation has changed somewhat, and we do in fact
                  have a proofing tool at our disposal now that makes
                  proofing the program comments both much more efficient
                  and much more reliable, for those program versions to
                  which it can be applied.&nbsp; I will write much more
                  about this in the future, but for right now I'll
                  merely note that SUNBURST 120 (Apollo 5) and AURORA
                  have already been through this process, with around
                  1000 errors fixed in AURORA and around 3000 fixed in
                  SUNBURST.&nbsp; COMANCHE 55 (Apollo 11 CM) is about
                  halfway through this process (according to GitHub
                  logs), and while I've lost count at the moment, I
                  think the errors fixed in its comments already top
                  5000.&nbsp; It should be noted that these fixes affect
                  only the <i>text</i>, without regard to the columnar
                  alignment (which will hopefully be addressed in the
                  future).&nbsp; Most of these fixes are trivial
                  matters, such as the presence or absence of a '.', so
                  the huge numbers of fixes aren't necessarily alarming
                  as it seems superficially.&nbsp; The goal is for the
                  program comments in our source-code files to exactly
                  match the original assembly listings, right down to
                  misspellings and typos.&nbsp; These improvements are
                  currently available in GitHub, and will continue to
                  become available as the process progresses.</li>

                Of course, I announced the AURORA 12 rope nearly a month
                ago, but for some curious reason failed to emphasize it
                as I normally do for new AGC versions, so I'm doing that
                now.&nbsp; In fact SUNBURST 120 has been available for a
                few days as well, though I forgot to update this
                change-log. In both cases, you still have to explicitly
                build the rope from the corresponding "binsource" file —
                "oct2bin &lt;Sunburst120.binsource" or "oct2bin
                &lt;Aurora12.binsource" — (with the rope being
                oct2bin.bin afterward), but you can do that and run
                either or both in yaAGC if you're of a mind to do
                so.&nbsp; In both cases, the source-code transcription
                is making progress, but isn't yet ready, so this is the
                only option if you want to run one of these programs
                right now rather than waiting for full availability. </div>

              <li>Lately I've been keeping all website changes at <a

                ibiblio overrides the character-set encoding; thus, some
                of the characters (like '—', 'μ', '±', etc.) were messed
                up on the ibiblio version but not on the GitHub version.
                I finally figured out how to override ibiblio's
                override, so I should be able to start pushing changes
                to ibiblio.org/apollo again.</li>

                available at our GitHub repo, though the transcribed
                source code for Aurora isn't yet available, so at least
                theoretically you can run Aurora in the AGC
                simulator.&nbsp; However, that would have to be done
                from yaAGC's command line, since Aurora 12 capability
                has not yet been integrated into the VirtualAGC GUI
                program.</li>
              <li>Niklas Beug has been developing a new feature for us,
                which is found in <a

                these scenarios are "core dumps" — exact copies of the
                AGC's "erasable memory" — with the appropriate pad loads
                and setups for running simulations of various mission
                scenarios. These core dumps are accompanied by nice
                writeups of what they are and how to use them. By
                loading the core dump into the AGC simulator, you're all
                set to go with the corresponding scenario!&nbsp; At the
                moment, there are only 4 scenarios, namely the Apollo 9,
                11, and 15 launch scenarios and the Apollo 7 rendezvous
                scenario (and yes, that's a real thing!), but presumably
                the number will grow.&nbsp; Eventually, this feature
                will be integrated into the VirtualAGC GUI program, but
                for now it's command-line only.&nbsp; Also, the setups
                come from NASSP, so you may find it more fulfilling to
                use them with NASSP then with "pure" Virtual AGC.<br>

            At least, they were long-awaited for <i>me</i>, because
            until today I saw them for the first and last time almost 12
            years ago to the day, and that's why there's no hair left on
            my head.&nbsp; (That's my theory, anyway.)<br>
            <br>
            But also, on a separate note, it has slowly dawned on me
            that I don't have AGC electrical schematics on our
            document-library page.&nbsp; I thought I did, but I
            don't!&nbsp; (No wonder I can never find them.)&nbsp; The
            Block II schematics, as contributed by Eldon Hall, have been
            on the klabs.org site for many years, but since NASA no
            longer funds it, that site is unfortunately now essentially
            a zombie and one wonders how much longer it will
            persist.&nbsp; So as of today, I'm now mirroring all
            relevant AGC material from that site here, in <a
              href="links.html">our document library</a>.&nbsp; The
            highlights of the additions are:<br>

                  interface-control data</a> (interface wiring and

                  and/or texts of talks</a> by AGC developers Hugh
                Blair-Smith, Ray Alonso, and Eldon Hall (as well as
                Frank O'Brien, Cline Frasier, and Jose Portillo Lugo) at
                the MAPLD '04 conference.</li>
              <li>Various new documents or cleaner versions of ones we
                already have, most-notably perhaps, an Apollo 16 Delco
                manual to supplement the existing A15 Delco manual, and
                a clean replacement for the mutilated-but-indispensable
                (if you're doing Block I work) R-393.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It also seems that there may be a perception on the part
              of the AGC modeling community, if there is such a thing,
              that the available Block II AGC schematics are so
              incomplete that constructing a hardware Block II AGC sim
              is impossible.&nbsp; (That's why, I've been told, everyone
              continues to do Block I sims.)&nbsp; Well, Mike Stewart
              has certainly made a Block II sim that's good enough to
              help him track down and fix bugs in our own software sim,
              so while the Block II schematics may not be perfect, they
              are certainly not so incomplete as to prevent using them
              for this kind of project.&nbsp; And here are Mike's links
              to prove it:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <div> <a
                  href="https://github.com/thewonderidiot/agc_hardware">https://github.com/thewonderidiot/agc_hardware</a><br>

            </blockquote>
            As it happens, Mike has given me his evaluation of the
            completeness/incompleteness of the Block II AGC schematics,
            and I provide that assessment in the document library as
            well, for anyone interested in this kind of thing.<br>

                    simulator has incorporated our AGC simulator for
                    many years. Until the last year or so, they have
                    been using it just for the Command Module
                    (apparently without difficulties), but have lately
                    begun trying to do lunar landings with it and have
                    been prevented due to the alarms and other problems
                    caused by the AGC simulator.&nbsp; However, with the

                    accomplish a lunar landing without alarms.&nbsp;

            It is, unfortunately, unclear if the code can ever be run in
            the AGC simulator or not, but I'll think about it for a
            while before saying "no".<br>
            <br>
            Second, and perhaps more importantly even though I haven't
            chosen to color it red, I was wrong in one very significant
            way about Francois Rautenbach's extractions of the
            rope-memory contents, and that is that it was <i>not</i>
            from Apollo 6 (<b>Solarium 055</b>) as I said, but rather is
            the <b>Corona</b> program from the AS-202 ("Apollo 3")
            mission, which we do not have already, and have no other
            prospects for acquiring.&nbsp; Moreover, it is simply in the
            form of stored electrical waveforms rather than a file of
            numbers representing the values stored at various memory
            locations.&nbsp; But perhaps it could be converted, and
            perhaps the <b>Corona</b> binary can be reverse-engineered
            back into the form of source code, which we will do if at
            all possible and present it here.&nbsp; So stay tuned.<br>

                for Apollo 4, which means that I have been in error for
                the last 7 years in saying that Solarium 055 was for
                Apollo 4.&nbsp; This has entailed numerous website

                files in 2010.&nbsp; However, proofing of the
                source-code files and of the binary were never completed
                at that time, though the binary was proofed to the
                extent that all checksums ("bugger words") were

                to be corrected, but can now be regarded as

                Gemini catch-up and rendezvous simulation program so
                that it can be run in a modern machine-independent
                Fortran.&nbsp; The problem (aside from my general
                laziness) is that the program does some stuff very
                specific to the IBM 704/7090/7094 which I don't
                understand, and therefore don't understand how to
                port.&nbsp; If there's anyone with the time and energy
                (or shockingly, the expertise) to handle this, I'd be
                grateful.&nbsp; Alternatively, there's a generally
                available simulator for that IBM computer system, and
                getting the program running on the simulator would also
                be a very interesting alternative.</li>
              <li>With various people's help (principally Mikael
                Uvebrandt and Jim Lawton), the Apollo 8 code (Colossus
                237) is almost ready for use, but not quite.&nbsp; It
                just requires some effort from me to close the gap and
                get it working.&nbsp; Keep your fingers crossed on this
                one.</li>
              <li>Helmuth Litfin has created software which he calls the
                "Ultimate DSKY Simulator", which (surprise!) is intended
                to be a DSKY simulation that is accurate in terms of
                physical dimensions and appearance, and more accurate in
                terms of behavior than my yaDSKY program.&nbsp; For
                example, in terms of the former, the Ultimate SDKY would
                appear on your computer screen with the same physical
                dimensions as a real DSKY.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the
                simulator is Windows-only and is not open source, and
                I'm not aware of it being presently available for use,
                so I can't actually give you a link to it; but I have
                seen a preliminary version almost (but not quite) worked
                with yaAGC.&nbsp; This is significant because the brief
                evaluation did reveal certain flaws in the behavior of
                yaDSKY, which Helmuth has explained to me in terms of
                the DSKY schematics, and therefore will probably have to
                be fixed at some point.&nbsp; The flaw relate
                principally to the DSKY's "standby" mode, and the manner
                in which the DSKY enters or leaves standby mode.&nbsp; I
                can't promise a time-frame for the fixes.&nbsp; If
                anybody is interested in the meantime, I can relate the
                details to you.<br>

            Now for other contributions and communications:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>A couple of years ago, Fabrizio Bernardini did a
                presentation on the AGC (in Italian), and was kind
                enough to provide English translations of the material
                he created.&nbsp; This pretty-extensive introduction has
                been added to our "<a href="ForDummies.html#Fabrizio">Kinder,

                  project</a>, apologising that he was sending the
                update and thus adding to my workload at a time when
                there seemed to be an "explosion of activity".&nbsp;
                (Pretty ironic, right?)&nbsp; I've now added those very
                extensive updates.</li>
              <li>At the same time, Dimitris also sent along a number of
                photos of various things in his personal collection
                which may be of interest, including bits and pieces of a
                block 1 AGC and DSKY, an LVDC, and an RCA-110A
                computer.&nbsp; I've included those photos on the
                relevant pages.</li>

                phases.&nbsp; Thus while we have no actual Gemini flight
                software at the present time, this is the next closest

                been debugged so that the assembled binary agrees with
                the octal listing from the hardcopy.&nbsp; The existing
                Artemis 72 binary that we have been providing since
                snapshot 20060110 was found to be in error, and was
                corrected in one place!&nbsp; The conversion to source
                was done by Hartmuth Gutsche, Onno Hommes, Jim Lawton,
                and Sergio Navarro, but Jim took it upon himself to
                perform the complete debugging of the source after it
                was created and I can attest that this is a large
                job.&nbsp; Kudos to all!</li>
              <li>Jim Lawton also seems to have single-handedly

                source-code files and octal.&nbsp; (Thanks, Jim!)&nbsp;
                We presently have no way to assemble the Block 1 source
                code in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>,
                so we don't yet have any way to verify the conversion;

                OBC and Apollo LVDC source (if we had any).&nbsp; But it
                does nothing useful yet, so it's sheer bravado on my

              <li>John Pultorak has sent me a game pack for the
                AGC.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; The pack includes a tic-tac-toe game
                (1 or 2 players) and a Simon game.&nbsp; I've included
                the games in the "Contributed" source tree, but there's
                presently no way to actually use them.&nbsp; There are
                two problems with trying to use it, and if anybody wants
                to fix them I'd be grateful:</li>
              <ol>
                <li>The code is written in the syntax of John's
                  assembler rather than <span style="font-weight:
                    bold;">yaYUL</span>.&nbsp; There are several mods
                  needed, the principal one being that John's assembler
                  doesn't have the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
                  limitation of 8-character upper-case labels.</li>
                <li>Rather than directly accessing the DSKY via i/o
                  channels, the code assumes the presence of some
                  Colossus code (including the executive) to manage this
                  activity.&nbsp; Figuring out just what portions of
                  Colossus to prune away to get room for the games is
                  quite tricky.&nbsp; It was done this way because John
                  envisaged the game pack as an add-on to Colossus ... a
                  kind of in-flight entertainment system.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;
                  However, for our purposes you could just as easily
                  eliminate all of the Colossus code and directly access
                  the DSKY.<br>

                have realized somewhat belatedly that it hasn't been
                about "links" for a long time now, and by pretending
                that it was I was just keeping people from easily
                finding the documents they needed.&nbsp; Well, it should
                be a lot easier now.&nbsp; Also, there are planned
                improvements (beyond just the continued accumulation)
                which should make it yet a better tool in the
                future.&nbsp; But we'll have to think about that another
                day.&nbsp; I suppose I should note just out of sheer
                compulsiveness that I haven't had time to do all of the
                processing I'd like to do on the documents now being
                uploaded, such as making the text searchable and putting
                in document metadata, but all that stuff will hopefully
                be added later.<br>

                  support on all platforms until these unprofessional
                  irritations can be resolved.&nbsp; On some platforms
                  this causes loss of the ability to use the up/down

                  command-line debugging, the commands to start the
                  simulation might be truncated and fail, and so the
                  simulation would abort at startup.&nbsp; Hopefully

                allowing the user to choose a custom AGC/AEA source or
                binary file to assemble and/or simulate, now starts from
                the user's home directory (or whatever the equivalent is
                on an operating-system by operating-system basis) when
                the custom name is blank.&nbsp; It also doesn't allow
                directory-changes to bleed through between the different

                You were previously able to assemble source code and run
                from here, but you couldn't do symbolic debugging or
                browse the source-code listing.&nbsp; In other words,
                the main GUI is now almost a one-stop shop for assembly
                and command-line debugging.&nbsp; You still have to
                provide your own editor or, if you want GUI-based
                debugging in Code::Blocks (for instance), you still need
                to do some manual stuff outside the GUI.<br>

                  bold;">yaAGC</span> without a DSKY obviously doesn't
                do very much, though in theory you could still run and
                debug AGC code from a command line (if the iPhone has
                such a thing).&nbsp; Since I don't have an iPhone and
                haven't bothered as of yet to download an iPhone
                development kit it's an open question if I've properly
                implemented Alberto's changes, but at least it's a
                start.&nbsp; There are some instructions on the <a

                when the Artemis072 source code is completely available)
                have added various Artemis072 source files, as well as
                making some corrections to existing Luminary099 and
                Comanche055 source files.</li>

              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> has
                been fixed so that <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
                249 is identified with Apollo 9 rather than Apollo
                8.&nbsp; The good news here is that I am now expecting <span

                Apollo 8) to actually be available soon, so we aren't
                really losing Apollo 8.</li>
              <li>The naming of all AGC source files has been changed
                from *.s to *.agc; that of all AEA source files has been
                changed from *.s to *.aea; that of all HTML files
                created from source has been changed from *.html to
                *.agc.html or *.aea.html.&nbsp; This has been done to
                play nicely with the AGA/AEA syntax highlighting which
                Google has been nice enough to add.&nbsp; I hope that I
                have tracked down all associated links on this website
                and fixed them, but I may have missed a few.&nbsp;

            It has been only partially proofed—less so than Comanche
            055—and so I won't feel great confidence until another
            proofing step or two has been done.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
            there's no reason (other than sad past experience) to think
            that it isn't okay as-is, as all of the memory-bank

                this.&nbsp; I would have sworn I had tested this after
                the last relevant change, but apparently did not.&nbsp;
                I promise you that with this snapshot I tried native
                builds in Linux, Win32 XP, Mac OS X 10.5, FreeBSD 7.2,

            I doubt that would justify a new download at this point,

            failing.<br>

                files of individual pages.&nbsp; When I say "reduced
                quality", I'm making a statement that is technically
                true, but I doubt anyone would see the difference unless
                they did a side-by-side comparison and zoomed in by
                about 3:1 or 4:1.&nbsp; The orginal giant PDFs&nbsp;
                (without the improvements I made in them) are still
                available elsewhere online if you want them.&nbsp; This
                change has been made to be more consistent with Comanche
                055 and Luminary 099, to make it easier for anyone who
                might want to volunteer to proof the program comments,
                and simply to reduce the disk space taken up.&nbsp; Not
                that ibiblio.org has complained or anything, but there's
                no value added in wasting the space!<br>

                  repository</a>, thanks to Onno Hommes.&nbsp; Developer
                snapshot tarballs and binary installation packages will
                continue to be produced, but the repository may contain
                more-recent data than in the snapshots.&nbsp; At some
                point in the future, once I become more comfortable with
                the repository, I may stop producing the source-code
                tarballs.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Onno Hommes forked the Virtual AGC source tree some
                time ago in order to make some extensive changes to the
                way debugging of AGC and AGS/AEA programs is done.&nbsp;
                These changes relate to the ability to use <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">gdb</span> style commands
                rather than the command-set I had invented, and to
                integrate with GUI debugger front-ends such as <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Code::Blocks</span>.&nbsp;
                In other words, Onno made debugging AGC programs a lot
                nicer.&nbsp; The source trees have now been
                re-merged.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                debugging has switched entirely to the new method, and
                the "classic" method previously described on the <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> page has been
                eliminated.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
                debugging is still undergoing change in this direction.</li>
              <li>When command-line debugging of AGC/AGS programs is
                being done, both <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> now
                use <span style="font-weight: bold;">readline</span>
                style command-editing and command-histories on all
                platforms.&nbsp; I had been unable to provide this
                feature on several platforms previously.<br>
              </li>
              <li>There is now a native-Windows build procedure listed
                on the download page, again thanks to Onno.</li>
              <li>The FreeBSD native build procedure may or may not be
                broken.&nbsp; I can't tell, because I've broken my
                FreeBSD installation.</li>
              <li>I've reduced some 30-second startup delays I
                introduced in the last snapshot to 5 seconds.&nbsp; The
                delays were based on the worst-case characteristics of
                some very slow test machines I am using, but aren't
                necessary for more-normal computers.&nbsp; I've instead
                added some configuration instructions to the download
                page if someone should need the longer delays.</li>
              <li>The cross-build instructions given in previous
                snapshots were wrong, in that some aspects would work

              <li>Configuration of the joystick for the ACA simulation,
                though simplified from previous times, was still
                annoyingly intricate.&nbsp; I've added small GUI program
                called <span style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span> to
                hopefully simplify the configuration process and bring
                it a little closer to where it needs to be.&nbsp;
                There's a button marked "Handler" next to the <span

                that enables the ACA, and clicking the button calls up <span

              <li>I've also managed to fix the annoying characteristic
                of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> that
                it couldn't display console output in Windows, and thus
                you couldn't see the information you actually needed for
                the joystick calibration.&nbsp; But it still doesn't
                work in Windows in spite of that, because after its
                window loses focus it never sees any more joystick
                events.<br>
              </li>
              <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>
                program, which has a joystick driver based on <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">wxWidgets</span>, has been
                added.&nbsp; So there are 3 separate ACA simulations to
                choose from, and hopefully at least one of them will
                work for you.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA2</span>
                doesn't seem to work in Mac OS X (though I believe I
                recall that it did originally), so at least for now it's
                disabled there.<br>
              </li>
              <li>A lot of work has been done in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> to
                display digital-downlink data in a format that would
                more closely correspond to the way ground control data
                was displayed in actual missions.&nbsp; The associated
                display formats are designated by the names MSK-683,
                MSK-966, MSK-1123, and MSK-1137.&nbsp; However, I don't
                have it actually working yet, so the extra controls
                which have been added to <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaTelemetry</span> for this purpose are
                disabled and grayed-out at present.</li>
              <li>In the Mac OS X version, it hasn't previously been
                possible to run <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                or <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> in
                debugging mode—and wouldn't have been possible to
                configure the joystick using <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">jWiz</span>—because of the lack of any
                command-line switches in the native <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Terminal</span> program and
                the practical inability to use <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">xterm</span> properly on
                the 10.4 and 10.3 platforms.&nbsp; Therefore, on the Mac
                platform we automatically include an open-source
                terminal program called <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">Terminator</span>, which allows <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> and <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">jWiz</span> to add back all
                of the missing functionality. It still isn't possible to
                use the debugger in 10.3, but it seems to be fine now in
                10.4 and 10.5.<br>
              </li>
              <li>Discovered (and fixed) that the endian conversions
                added previously to make symbol tables portable between
                Intel and PowerPC platforms weren't yet working.</li>
              <li>On the links page I've added a new document, the "<a
                  href="Documents/SMR-downsampled.tar.bz2">Saturn Ground
                  Control System Mathematical Subroutine Manual</a>".&nbsp;

                get too excited, because it's not what you think it is:
                the "mathematical subroutines" are algorithms for
                multiplication, division, trig functions, etc.&nbsp;

            (hand-controller) simulation not working on some versions of

            using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>
            simulation program (which superceded the earlier <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> simulation program
            for snapshots 20090331 and later), the <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> GUI front-end
            now allows for using <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
            and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> somewhat
            interchangeably.&nbsp; Basically, it will use <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> unless it notices
            that <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> has been
            configured, and then it will use <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">yaACA</span> instead.&nbsp; The <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> program has also
            been tricked up similarly to the <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">yaACA3</span> program in that it now automatically
            saves its joystick-related switches to a configuration file,
            so that they become the defaults at the next run. &nbsp; <a

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">I fixed the FreeBSD bugs
            mentioned yesterday, and am now willing to say that Virtual
            AGC works in FreeBSD.&nbsp; Instructions for building from
            source on FreeBSD have been added to the <a
              href="download.html#FreeBSD">download page</a>.&nbsp; I'd
            be lying, though, if I said it was thoroughly tested.&nbsp;
            Unfortunately, I only have FreeBSD running in a virtual
            machine, and the marriage of FreeBSD (PC-BSD) to VirtualBox
            has not proved a happy one for me, so my ability to test the
            the FreeBSD installation is very crude.&nbsp; When I say
            Virtual AGC "works", I mean that I can run <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>, that I can
            start the simulation, that I can put in verbs and nouns on
            the DSKY and it does what I expect it to do, that I can see
            telemetry downlinks, and that I can perform digital
            uplinks.&nbsp; If anyone wants to send me more data, I'd be
            happy to see it, but I've done all I expect to do on the
            FreeBSD side in the absence of feedback.<br>

            useful stuff which I've added.&nbsp; I won't detail those

            made to material on the the website itself, thanks to
            Fabrizio Bernardini:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>We now know with a higher degree of certainty that
                Luminary 1E build 210 was flown in Apollo 17 (and
                probably Apollo 15-16), whereas before there was some
                dispute that it might have instead been Luminary 1D
                build 209.&nbsp; This is significant in the sense that
                we're aware of a listing for 1D (and may even get a copy
                of it someday), but we're not aware of the existence of
                a copy of 1E.&nbsp; As to what the differences between
                1D and 1E are, that will await future revelations!&nbsp;
                Perhaps there are none.<br>
              </li>
              <li>We are now aware that AGS Flight Program 8 was used in
                Apollo 15-17, rather than in Apollo 14 as previously
                supposed.&nbsp; This is significant because we actually
                have a copy of Flight Program 8 included within the
                project, and it's good to know what we have!<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            Software-wise, lots of bugs have been fixed and auxiliary
            changes associated with those fixes have been made, so that
            I'm not even sure I remember them all.&nbsp; Here are some
            of the ones that stand out in my mind as particularly
            significant:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>There was an issue in sequencing key-releases with
                shifting of buffered keypad data in communications
                between <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA/yaDEDA2</span>
                and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>,
                which could basically break AGS communications,
                requiring a reboot of the simulation to fix it.&nbsp;
                The effect was fairly repeatable if the HOLD key was hit
                and then the READ OUT key was hit.&nbsp; I *hope* it's
                fixed now.&nbsp; A new --debug-deda switch in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> helped me find
                this one.</li>
              <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> --debug
                modes were crippled using the as-distributed symbol
                tables for <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
                and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>,
                because they embedded path names to the source-code
                files that were set at compile time ... in other words,
                for the symtabs I've been distributing, they pointed to
                source files in directories on <span style="font-style:
                  italic;">my</span> computer.</li>
              <li>Moreover, the symbol tables used the natural
                endianness of the CPU, meaning that symbol tables
                generated on an Intel architecture would not work if I
                distributed them to a PowerPC architecture.</li>
              <li>There was a bug in the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGC</span> core-dump and --resume, in which
                half the time resuming from a core-dump would cause the
                DSKY to become non-responsive.&nbsp; My believe is that
                some state information (probably relating to interrupts)
                was not being saved in the core-dumps.</li>
              <li>I think there was a bug in direction flags
                (displacement direction of the control stick from
                detent) sent to the AGC by <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaACA</span> when more than one axis was
                displaced.&nbsp; The bug carried over into <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span> (see below)
                as well, but I fixed it in both places.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            In terms of new features, again there are lots.&nbsp; Some
            of the more significant ones are:<br>
            <ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> has
                also been given a capability not present in any software
                existing previously to the GUI, in that it can perform
                scripted Digital Uplinks to the AGC.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>
                integrates AGC/AEA compilation and source-code browsing,
                in addition to merely managing the simulation.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> have been
                modified so that when in --debug mode they no longer
                output status messages like socket connections or
                disconnections of peripherals, thus giving an "easier"
                to understand debugging experience.</li>
            </ul>
            While it is basically a feature-neutral change, the ACA
            emulation program <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
            has been superceded by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA3</span>,
            principally to allow the use <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">SDL</span> rather than <span style="font-weight:
              bold;">Allegro</span> for providing the joystick
            interface.&nbsp; The initial motivation for this was that
            Paul Fjeld (thanks, Paul!) advised that <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">SDL</span>'s joystick code was
            more stable than <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allegro</span>'s
on

























































































































































































































































































































































            Mac OS X.&nbsp; However, having made this replacement, I
            find some other significant advantages, the two principal
            being that there is far less configuration burden (and what
            configuration there is I've integrated in a way that won't
            be painful for <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>),
and

























































































































































































































































































































































            that I find I hadn't noticed before that <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> provides
            absolutely no console feedback on Windows, making debugging
            that much more painful.&nbsp; I've also taken the
            opportunity to use static linking for <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">SDL</span>, to avoid
            distributing <span style="font-weight: bold;">Allegro</span>'s
dll.&nbsp;

























































































































































































































































































































































            So hopefully it's a win-win-win-win kind of dealio.<br>

            program will additionally have convenient installers for
            Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X, which is something which has
            been lacking up to now.&nbsp; At the same time, I've fixed
            the problem that (as previously installed by Virtual AGC)
            Stephan Hotto's <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>

          <td style="vertical-align: top;">The current development
            snapshot fixes a bug which has existed since 2007-03-16 in
            the development snapshots, but not in any of the binary
            downloads (since I've not posted new versions of the binary
            downloads in that time period).&nbsp; The bug, very simply,
            is that the <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
            module would abort if used in a CM simulation, even though
            it would work in an LM simulation.&nbsp; The upshot of this
            is that if you tried to start a CM simulation using any of
            the provided scripts (<span style="font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249</span>,
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimColossus249_lite</span>,

              style="font-weight: bold;">SimArtemis072_lite</span>) then
            the simulation would abort with an error message.&nbsp; I
            suspect that some folks have complained to me about this and
            that I blew them off with an explanation that there was
            something misconfigured about their computers.&nbsp; If you
            complained and I ignored it, I apologize.<br>
            <br>
            Development of Virtual AGC has been on hold for a while, but
            I expect it to pick up again soon, with a vengeance.&nbsp;

          <td style="vertical-align: top;"> Stephan Hotto has sent
            version 1.0 of <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>,
            both in source code and in the Windows "stand-alone"
            executable version, with the following notes:<br>
            <ul>
              <li>FDAI now fully functional! The attitude looks a bit
                confusing around \B190 degrees Yaw but that is for the
                reason that LM_Simulator does not uses a real
                3-dimensional ball to show the attitude. Please keep in
                mind that the LM-IMU has its Gimbal Lock Condition on
                the Roll-Axis and not on the Yaw-Axis like the Command
                Module has.</li>
              <li>A Checkbutton in the FDAI window now allows to switch
                off the 8-Ball for computers with low performance.&nbsp;
                [LM_Simulator's CPU performance has been greatly
                improved from a month or two ago, but you still might
                like to reduce it some, and updating the 8-ball is the
                majority of the CPU time used by LM_Simulator.&nbsp;
                Thus, the option for switching it off.]<br>
              </li>
              <li>FDAI angles are additionally presented as numerical
                values.</li>
              <li>New lm_configuration.ini parameters:</li>

                <li>Operationg_System "Windows/Linux" - To allow one
                  source code for both operating systems.</li>
                <li>FDAI_Update_Rate "updates per second" - Choose a
                  lower value if you experience performance problems.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>New HTML documentation as well as re-work of the
                existing documents.&nbsp; [The HTML documentation is in
                the development snapshot under the directory

            Please remember if you're using the development snapshot
            (rather than the Windows stand-alone executable) that to

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Now the FDAI shows the
              correct 8-ball angles - currently with a limitation to:<br>

              "Crew Defined Maneuver Routine V49". By initiating this
              routine you must provide the desired destination IMU
              Gimbal Angles, subsequently the AGC presents you with the
              associated FDAI angles it steers the LM to (please refer
              to the Tutorial). Because of the above mentioned
              limitation those FDAI angles should be in the defined

                AGC architecture allows for a wacky feature using the <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">BRUPT</span> register,
                in which an interrupt-service routine can place in
                instruction into <span style="font-family: monospace;">BRUPT</span>
                to be executed upon return from interrupt.&nbsp; In
                other words, the instruction executed upon return from
                an interrupt doesn't have to be the instruction that's
                at the location to which the program returns.&nbsp; I
                had implemented this feature, but couldn't figure out
                why anyone would want to do anything so crazy, and so
                disabled it by default.&nbsp; 'x15' of the group which
                has integrated Virtual AGC into the <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Orbiter</span> spacecraft
                simulator has discovered that this feature <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">does</span> need to be
                activated for proper operation, as the multi-tasking
                performed by the program executive makes use of
                it.&nbsp; The effect of turning off this feature is that
                the digital autopilot will hit the dreaded <span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">EDRUPT</span>
                instruction, and hence reset the AGC from time to
                time.&nbsp; Hence, it is now activated by default.&nbsp;
                (You can get this feature without a new download by
                compiling Virtual AGC with the command "make
                -DALLOW_BSUB".)<br>

                Hotto has sent in a major update, v. 0.8, that he

                processor</li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Additionally, Stephan tells
              us:<br>
              <br>
              <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The DAP is now stable
                around all axes and even the "DAP V49 Crew Defined
                Maneuver" routine steers the LM exactly into the right
                orientation.<br>
                <br>
                There was a major bug in the IMU coordination
                transformation that caused the DAP instabilities.<br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, to handle single RCS jet events it was
                necessary to transform the U,V jet system into the P,Q,R
                pilot axes.<br>
                <br>
                The whole dynamical model of the LM is now based on the
                equations used for the DAP state estimator. This
                approach makes the model very precise and comparable to
                the real thing.<br>
                <br>
                To assure the right AGC initialization it is necessary

                <li>After start of the simulation the following steps
                  have to be executed (please use the Tutorial as a

            changes for a while, so let's hope I manage to remember them
            all.&nbsp; The reason I was holding on is that I have seen
            some segfaults in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            when manipulating the RHC.&nbsp; However, now that I am

                  separate commands each, one of which is a "fast" count
                  at 6400 counts per second, and the other of which is a
                  "slow" count at 400 counts per second.&nbsp; This
                  replaces the 800 count-per-second buffering used in
                  the 2005-10-05 snapshot.&nbsp; (But there's some doubt

                <li>The WATCH command (used in --debug mode) has been

                <li>A new command called VIEW has been added to --debug

                Provides a complementary feature to yesterday's <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> update,
                in that it internally buffers all PCDU or MCDU commands
                to the CDUX, CDUY, and CDUZ counter registers, and
                actually applies them to the counters at an 800 cps
                rate.&nbsp; In other words, the simulated IMU can feed
                in new angle measurements as fast as it likes, but they
                are now applied to the simulated AGC's internal counters
                only at an 800 cps rate.&nbsp; The reason for this is
                that the real IMU communicated with the real AGC using
                an 800 cps signal, and the digital autopilot (DAP) in
                the Luminary/Colossus software employs a digital filter
                based on this assumed counter update rate.&nbsp; The
                filter was intended to eliminate electrical noise and or
                noisy angles due to the vibration of the spacecraft, but
                it also has been causing rejection of changes to the
                CDUX, CDUY, and CDUZ counters that don't conform to the
                assumed 800 cps timing.&nbsp; Consequently, the
                simulated IMU has been feeding info on the spacecraft
                orientation to the simulated CPU, but the DAP has been
                rejecting this info.&nbsp; I don't claim that this
                change has been extensively tested, though, and an
                erasable pad load is needed to set the DAP's "Kalman
                filter" characteristics, or else the CDU inputs will
                continue to be rejected anyhow.&nbsp; (But I don't quite
                know what those pad loads are yet.)&nbsp; Thanks, as
                usual, to Stephan for figuring this out.<br>

                      show how far the DAP is away from the wished axes
                      positions.</li>
                    <li>DSKY: V62E -&gt; DISPLAY TOTAL ATTITUDE ERRORS
                      WITH RESPECT TO NOUN 22.&nbsp; Here the needles
                      display the absolute difference between the entry
                      shown by V16N22E and V16N20E. Normally used for
                      automatic positioning.</li>
                    <li>DSKY: V60E -&gt; DISPLAY VEHICLE ATTITUDE RATES
                      ON FDAI ERROR NEEDLES. These outputs should
                      provide the same information as the FDAI rate
                      indicators do. The Roll, Yaw and Pitch rate shown
                      by the FDAI bases on a separate Rate Gyro Assembly
                      fixed mounted to the LM body, whereas the
                      Information on the needles shown by V60E is
                      derived from the AGC measurement of the angular
                      changes. This is also a backup mode in case of a
                      Rate Gyro Assembly Fault.</li>

                builds properly on their *nix systems, because of new
                dependencies I've forgotten to document.&nbsp; Namely,
                you now need "readline-devel" and "curses" (or else
                "ncurses" with a symbolic link making it appear to be

                lot of changes, thanks to Stephan Hotto.&nbsp; You
                should particularly note the changes to the tutorial (in
                the Contributed/LM_Simulator/doc directory).&nbsp;
                Here's what Stephan has to say about it:<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <ul>
                <li>Used the new LM-Coordinates to re-code the whole
                  IMU-Module</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>IMU Coarse Align</li>
                  <li>IMU Fine Align</li>
                  <li>PIPA Vectors</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Gimbal Lock (Middle Gimbal) on LM-Z-Axis (Roll-Axis)</li>
                <li>Complete re-work of the RCS Thruster handling:</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>4 Thruster Mode along X, Y, Z axes</li>
                  <li>2 Thruster Mode (Minimum Impulse Mode) along X, Y,
                    Z, U, V axes</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Remark: THC (Crew-Inputs) activates the correct
                  thrusters to translate the LM along the X,Y,Z axes.
                  This increase in speed is not jet reflected within the
                  IMU PIPAs.</li>
                <li>Update of the tutorial to reflect the DAP mode and
                  data load routines.</li>
              </ul>
              The summary of these changes is that for some time we've
              been trying to correctly match all of the various thrust
              and rotational axes of the simulation with the axes
              assumed by the Luminary and Colossus, and hopefully have
              them all correct now. However,&nbsp; the DAP is not yet
              stabilizing the LM even after loading the correct data
              (e.g. LM weight) as in the updated tutorial. It just
              bounces back and forth around the desired orientation,
              until it runs out of fuel.&nbsp; Obviously, we're still
              working on figuring that out!<br>

                directed to Stephan's real tutorial in the development
                snapshot.&nbsp; (It was too hard to keep the two in

                to Stephan Hotto.)&nbsp; The mapping of pitch/yaw/roll
                axes to thruster/joystick axes has been modified.&nbsp;
                The ATTITUDE HOLD mode thus now actually works (and
                attempts to hold the attitude) rather than merely
                allowing thrusters to fire.&nbsp; However, there is an
                overcompensation, so that the attitude overshoots,
                resulting in continual corrections and eventual
                exhaustion of fuel.&nbsp; This may be due to mismatch
                between the AGC's and IMU's assumptions about the LM's
                inertial characteristics.&nbsp; At any rate, it's a big
                improvement, but we haven't crossed the finish line yet.<br>

                The freeze-up problem in ATTITUDE HOLD mode has been
                fixed, I hope.&nbsp; For anyone who has been holding off
                on downloading new development snapshots, I think it's
                okay to do so now.<br>

                to make it easier to build Virtual AGC with MS Visual

                <li>The current version of yaAGC has a mysterious
                  problem.&nbsp; I'm not sure when this problem
                  began.&nbsp; (I suspect the underlying problem was
                  always present, but that it was masked by other
                  problems in versions 20050814 and prior, so that it
                  was not noticeable.)&nbsp; The problem can be observed
                  as follows:&nbsp; Suppose you run <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary131</span>, then
                  you activate ATTITUDE HOLD mode, then you use the hand
                  controller to fire the thrusters.&nbsp; At some later
                  time, you'll find that the AGC has become largely
                  unresponsive, though it still responds in an automatic
                  way to certain stimuli.&nbsp; The only way of
                  recovering from this is to restart the
                  simulation.&nbsp; Fixing this problem is my top
                  priority at present.</li>

                me.&nbsp; (For arithmetic with a double-precision
                negative value in which the less-significant word was
                +0, the more-significant word would have been
                arbitrarily converted to -0.&nbsp; Admittedly, I don't
                know if this situation ever occurred in practice, but
                it's great to have it fixed.)&nbsp; Also, Markus Joachim
                has sent a fix for timing in some output pulses
                generated by the CPU; the timing error was not

                  project</a>, needed for building <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> in Win32, has
                changed its library-naming, so that you can't use newer
                versions of this library without manually editing a
                couple of Virtual AGC makefiles.&nbsp; The stock Virtual
                AGC makefiles now auto-select a Pthreads-w32 library
                version in a way that's hopefully adequate to obviate
                the need for manual editing.&nbsp; Note that I've not
                personally had the chance yet to try it out with the
                newer versions of Pthreads-w32, so your mileage may
                vary.<br>

                Specifically, header-file changes have been made that
                should allow you to link Virtual AGC libraries to C++

                first, but fortunately that's really easy.&nbsp; For
                now, I'll just note that you use the Linux build
                instructions, and you have to do 'make NOREADLINE=yes",
                because for some reason Jordan's command-history stuff
                doesn't build.&nbsp; Also, the stuff for shutting down
                all of the components of the simulation gracefully
                doesn't work, so comment out the line reading "SimStop"

                the steps to running the simulation are to run "startx"
                from a <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cygwin</span>
                command line, and then to run <span style="font-weight:

                from the X-terminal.&nbsp; I'll write up the

                particularly interesting, because it documents and

                into AGC erasable core memory rather than fixed core
                memory.&nbsp; In other words, these are the programs

                Jordan Slott has added a few fixes to the recent --debug
                mode features.&nbsp; Because of the fixes, 'readline'
                support is now enabled by default in the
                Makefiles.&nbsp;<br>

                <li>Repaired some spurious printing of prompts during
                  AGC program execution.</li>
                <li>"Break" was no longer working.&nbsp; This is now
                  fixed.&nbsp; [That was my fault, not Jordan's ---
                  RSB.]</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> now
                  builds when readline support is enabled, and actually
                  works in Win32.&nbsp; In other words, you can get a
                  command history.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight:
                    bold;">Warning:</span>&nbsp; In Linux, <span

                  <span style="font-style: italic;">no longer functions
                    properly</span>, regardless of whether you compile
                  with or without readline support.&nbsp; Hopefully that
                  will be fixed Real Soon Now.&nbsp; (If you need
                  --debug mode in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
                  under Linux or Mac OS X, please hold off on

                  a breakpoint it does not print a "&gt;" prompt. You

                Jordan has added some further frills to the --debug
                mode.&nbsp; Here are the notes on the changes:</li>
            </ul>
            <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
              <li>Added the "files &lt;regex&gt;" debugging command.
                This lists the source files matching the given regular
                expression.&nbsp;<br>
              </li>
              <li>Reworked the "break" command. Now "break *address" is
                used to add a breakpoint at a memory address, as in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">gdb</span>.&nbsp; The
                "break &lt;line&gt;" is used to break at a line number,
                whenever &lt;line&gt; can be parsed as an integer.
                Update "help break" to reflect this change.</li>
              <li>Improved the output from "breakpoints" a bit -- for
                those breakpoints specified using a symbol or a line
                number, it outputs the <span
                  class="moz-txt-link-freetext">file:line</span> from
                where it can be found. Note that I do not output <span
                  class="moz-txt-link-freetext">file:line</span> if you
                create a breakpoint using a memory address, although I
                don't think this would be difficult to do.</li>
              <li>Fixed a small bug in "list from,to" where the line
                numbers were not being displayed.</li>
              <li>Cleaned up some of my old code in symbol_table.c</li>
              <li>Added the ability to use libreadline to read in the
                debugger command line. The upshot is you get source file
                name completion, history, etc.&nbsp; (<span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>:&nbsp; Though
                apparently functional, this feature is currently
                disabled in the Makefile, because of some conflicts
                which prevent yaAGS from building.&nbsp; Hopefully it
                can be fixed up soon.)<br>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
              <li>Startup scripts:&nbsp; After performing some upgrades
                on my main Linux workstation, I found that the startup
                scripts (<span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>,
                etc.) have become unreliable and may randomly shut down
                the simulation.&nbsp; (It's a problem in the
                relatively-recently-added feature that shutting down any
                component of the simulation, such as <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>, shuts down
                all of the other components, such as <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>.)&nbsp;
                This should not affect Windows users, but potentially
                affect everyone else.&nbsp; I don't know how to fix this
                problem with any satisfying degree of certainty, but
                workarounds have been added that should reduce the
                probability of such a random shutdown to a very low
                order of probability.</li>

                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>:&nbsp; Jordan
                has greatly improved the symbolic debugging, with the
                greatest improvement being that (where possible) the
                actual source code is displayed rather than disassembled
                source code.&nbsp; This lets you see not only program
                labels and variable names, but even program
                comments.&nbsp; Several versions of <a
                  href="yaAGC.html#LIST">the LIST command</a> have been
                implemented in the debugger, so that you can get various
                types of disassemblies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, it's all
                related to the source files by filename and line number,
                so it's cross-referenced much more nicely.&nbsp; I'd say
                this feature is now at a completely satisfying stage,
                from a user's point of view.&nbsp; <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp; The
                symbol tables created for this functionality are now <span
                  style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">quite
                  large</span>.&nbsp; (About 11 megabytes each for <span

                  style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus249</span>.)&nbsp;
                Therefore, you'll now find that Virtual AGC is chewing a
                lot more disk space than before.<br>

                Slott (thanks, Jordan!) has sent in a very cool mod that
                integrates symbol tables produced by <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span> into the
                "--debug" mode of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp;

                upshot of this is that in some cases you can use
                symbolic names when debugging, rather than being forced
                to use absolute numeric addresses all the time.&nbsp;
                It's still not fully implemented, but it's pretty
                valuable nonetheless.&nbsp; Refer to the <a
                  href="yaAGC.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                  page</a> to see how to use it.&nbsp; Symbolic
                debugging was on my wish list, but I was too lazy to do
                anything about it.&nbsp; Besides, it was very brave of
                Jordan to poke around in my source code.&nbsp;
                (Hopefully there won't be too much emotional
                scarring.)&nbsp; This builds and works on both Linux and
                Win32, but I haven't had a chance to try it in MacOS X.<br>

              <li>Scans of the Colossus 3 GSOP document have begun
                filtering in.&nbsp; (Thanks to Shelly Kelly and U. H.
                Clear Lake.)&nbsp; I only have section 1 and a small
                chunk of section 2 right now, but more is coming.&nbsp;
                (This is nicely coincident, of course, with the fact
                that the Colossus 3 source code is also dribbling in,
                and the GSOP document is basically the program
                documentation.)<br>

                produced by <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaYUL</span>
                on Linux vs. Windows platforms has been fixed.&nbsp;
                (One octal word in Colossus249 was being assembled
                incorrectly in Win32; the incorrect octal word was being
                repaired by a workaround in the makefile, but would
                actually have executed properly even if it hadn't been
                repaired.&nbsp; Now that <span style="font-weight:

                --pitch, and --roll adjustments, or even their default
                values; for me, this only affected the Win32 platform
                (with the symptom being that in ATTITUDE HOLD, the
                thrusters were continually firing to increase yaw), but
                it has been fixed for all platforms.&nbsp; The program
                has been tweaked so that its timing is much more
                convenient in Mac OS X.&nbsp; Also, if it does not find
                a joystick on start-up, it keeps trying until it finds
                one, so you can plug in the joystick after startup
                without having to restart the simulation.<br>

              <li>MS Windows:&nbsp; A few days ago I was able to modify
                the startup scripts (<span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>,
                etc.) in Linux so that:&nbsp; a) they don't open so many
                useless windows; and b) they shutdown all of the Virtual
                AGC apps and windows when you choose to exit from any
                one of them.&nbsp; This is tremendously convenient, and
                is theoretically possible in Windows XP Pro, but not
                (apparently) in Windows XP Home, or any other version of
                Windows.&nbsp; The facilities for doing process
                management simply aren't provided in Windows in a form
                usable by batch files.&nbsp; So instead, I've written a
                program (WinAGC.exe) that accomplishes the same
                thing.&nbsp; It's a program that simply runs groups of
                programs, and then shuts down all of those programs when
                any one of them shuts down.&nbsp; I've revamped all of
                the Windows batch files (SimLuminary131.bat, etc.) so
                that they take advantage of WinAGC.exe.&nbsp; This
                should work in any version of Windows, but I've only
                tried it in Windows 98 (first edition), Windows XP Home,
                and Windows XP Pro.&nbsp;<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> The downside is that you
              can no longer use any command-line parameters with the
              batch files.&nbsp; I've tried to make intelligent choices
              as to which command-line switches you might want, but if
              I'm wrong you need to edit one or another of the files
              SimLuminary131.xeq, SimLuminary131_lite.xeq,
              SimColossus249.xeq, or SimColossus249_lite.xeq.&nbsp;
              (These ".xeq" files contain the lists of files, along with
              their command-line parameters, that are run by
              WinAGC.exe.)&nbsp; Even then, there are some things you
              can't accomplish, such as running <span
                style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> or <span
                style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> in --debug
              mode.&nbsp; If you want to do that, I'd suggest setting
              the environment variable NOWINAGC=yes before running the
              startup scripts, as this will restore the batch files to
              their pre-WinAGC glory.<br>
              <br>
              Another downside is that that <span style="font-weight:
                bold;">Allegro</span> and <span style="font-weight:
                bold;">Tcl/Tk</span> are now really requirements rather
              than options, although I've not had a chance to update the
              instructions yet.&nbsp; The reason is that the startup
              scripts will abort if <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
              and <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
              cannot be run, rather than ignoring it.&nbsp; (I must say,
              though, that you really want to run both of these things,
              although admittedly <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span>
              isn't of much use without a "3D game controller" --- i.e.,
              a joystick.&nbsp; Therefore, buy a joystick.)&nbsp; If you
              absolutely don't want to run these programs, or cannot for
              some reason, edit the appropriate ".xeq" file and prefix
              the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaACA</span> and/or
              <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> lines

                Some fixes have been made that can prevent the CPU
                utililization from shooting up to very high levels under
                some circumstances.<br>

                allow automatic shutdown of the simulation when any of
                the apps closes.&nbsp; I further <span
                  style="font-style: italic;">hope</span> that the
                scripts continue to work as before in non-XP-Pro
                versions of Windows.&nbsp; To activate the new script
                feature, you need to set the environment variable XPPRO
                to anything non-blank.&nbsp; Since I don't have a
                computer with XP Pro available, I haven't been able to
                try the new feature out.<br>

                <li>Fixes a critical bug within DSKY Lite which causes a
                  serious memory problem and therefore the slows down
                  handling the socket data when "Attitude Hold" was

                <li>The simulation of the joystick is very limited jet
                  and just in an experimental status. The steering
                  commands are only recognized when they are along the
                  three axis (Roll, Pitch and Yaw). A combined steering
                  command (e.g. u or v axis) is not yet
                  implemented.&nbsp; Also, the calculation of the RCS
                  fire time is based on the setting within the "Attitude
                  &amp; Speed Control" window.&nbsp; The simulation just
                  takes the RCS thruster time and multiplies that time
                  with the joystick amplitude divided by 57.&nbsp; That
                  means that a full stick deflection takes the selected
                  time as RCS fire time.</li>

                  Moment of Inertia along all three axes is identical
                  (which is obviously not completely true for the real
                  world).&nbsp; MOI change is stable over the whole LM
                  weight range (which is comparable with real world
                  behavior).</li>
                <li>It now interoperates with <span style="font-weight:

                  attitude-hold, you can see the digital auto-pilot
                  (DAP) firing thrusters in response to displacement of
                  the rotational hand-controller (RHS).&nbsp; Of course,
                  if you don't have a 3D joystick, this will be of
                  little value to you.&nbsp; Also, the connection has
                  not yet been made between the thrust outputs of the
                  CPU and the thrust inputs of the IMU.&nbsp; In other
                  words, while the IMU can respond to thrust inputs
                  entered into it manually, it will not yet respond to
                  the thrust commands generated by the CPU.&nbsp; (By
                  the way, turning on ATTITUDE HOLD causes a program
                  alarm 32000---which is a CPU overload---but this is

                  style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span> simulation
                would always start up using the <span

              <li>In general:&nbsp; Virtual AGC has been opening so many
                windows on your screen, that it's very difficult not
                only to manage them, but also to make sure you get all
                of the individual programs closed when you want to exit
                the simulation.&nbsp; The startup scripts have now been
                modified to that in Linux, so that not only are less
                xterms open, but also closing any one of the
                applications (like <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>)
                will also close all of the other applications and
                windows as well.&nbsp; I only found out how to do this
                by accident, and it's awfully convenient!&nbsp; I don't
                know how to do this in Windows, but I'm sure I'll figure
                it out one of these days.&nbsp; (Of course, if anybody

                rather than adding angular displacements around the
                pitch/yaw/roll axes, you can apply thrust around the
                pitch/yaw/roll axes.&nbsp; Once you start playing with <span

                stop!)&nbsp; The calculation of the "moment of inertia"
                by using the LM mass distribution is not yet correctly
                implemented.&nbsp; The values used are just
                experimental.&nbsp; The calculation of the RCS
                propellant consumption depends on the RCS impulse length
                and should be correct within in the current simulation
                which uses 445N for each thruster and a specific impulse
                of 2840MS.&nbsp; The Attitude control uses an impulse

              <li>Stephan has sent a new version of <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>.&nbsp;
                Here are the changes:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Workarounds added when we believed the
                  fine-alignment problems were on the <span
                    style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span> side
                  rather than the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                  side have been removed.&nbsp; (Specifically, the
                  angle-increment value is corrected, and the coordinate
                  transformation has been deactivated.)</li>
                <li>Drives the IMU to Zero when the "Zero IMU CDU"
                  signal is activated. Now the IMU zeros after V36E (AGC
                  reset) but there are cases where the AGC lefts the
                  signal active. After using the crew button "Zero
                  IMU..." the signal goes back to zero.</li>
                <li>Drive the IMU only when "Coarse Align Enable of IMU"
                  is activated. This is really an important change,
                  because in the "Attitude Hold Mode" the AGC uses the
                  counters to drive the error needles and the autopilot
                  misalignment. If the IMU was driven in such cases,
                  then the FDAI would jump uncontrollably over a small
                  angle area.</li>
                <li>Socket Timeout added. If there is a period longer
                  than 2 seconds when no data appears on the socket,
                  then the LM Simulator assumes that the AGC has been
                  terminated. After showing an error message: "Lost
                  connection to yaAGC" the program terminates
                  itself.&nbsp; (This is a slight problem when yaAGC is
                  run in --debug mode.&nbsp; We are looking at fixes for
                  that case now.)</li>
                <li>Attitude &amp; Speed Control has been changed.&nbsp;
                  (You don't have the same precise level of control over
                  roll, pitch, and yaw as before, but it's much easier
                  to use.)<br>

                    now be regarded as functional.&nbsp; (The next level
                    needed will be to feed spacecraft accelerations and
                    rotation into the IMU automatically rather than
                    manually.)<br>

                Well, I was wrong, and there still were fixups that
                needed to be made in order to get fine-alignment to

              <ul>
                <li>FDAI finalized (Z-Axis added)</li>
                <li>A bug fix for counting.&nbsp; [To keep the simulated
                  angles equal to those of the AGC there is a need for
                  both an external counter which stores the IMU angles
                  in high resolution and a counter which counts in angle
                  increments of (0.01Deg).&nbsp; Previously, only the
                  latter was used, leading to large angle misalignments
                  after several attitude changes. Now, there is a
                  synchronization between the counters, which enables a
                  sufficient precision in angle handling.]</li>
              </ul>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>:&nbsp;
                Previously, there was no use made of the GYROCMD counter
                register in gyro torquing during fine-alignment.&nbsp;
                Since the GYROCMD register is the central entity in this
                operation, that pretty much ruined it.&nbsp; The upshot
                of this fix is that IMU fine-alignment should now work
                properly.<br>

              style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>'s ability to
            display downlink lists so much that I've split off that
            ability from the "--test-uplink" command-line switch, and
            added it to a new "--test-downlink" command-line
            switch.&nbsp; In fact, "--test-downlink" is used by default
            in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>

            startup scripts.&nbsp; Of course, the ability to completely
            display all downlink lists isn't quite available.&nbsp;
            However, the erasable dump downlist is still available, and
            the AGS initialization/update downlist is complete.<br>

              <li>Rewrote a lot of the telemetry-downlink formatting
                code I added yesterday.&nbsp; I realized that I could
                write it in a way that was much more flexible so that

                apps, with mere replacement of a pointer to the function
                that does the actual output.&nbsp; In other words, the
                code is now completely reusable, and independent of the
                output device.&nbsp; Consequently, I feel much more
                enthusiastic about going ahead to do more work on it.</li>
              <li>Stephan has sent over a new version of <span

                Here's a summary of the changes, as I understand them:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>There are now Roll, Pitch and Yaw commands in the
                  attitude window, which translate into the associated
                  IMU gimbal angle changes.&nbsp; (Previously, there
                  were X, Y, Z gimbal-angle commands that simply drove
                  the gimbal angles without translation.)</li>
                <li>There is a kind FDAI ball in the IMU window now,
                  though Stephan points out that "with TCL/TK there is
                  no chance to create a <span style="font-style:
                    italic;">real</span> FDAI ball." (Even so, in my
                  humble opinion, it seems darned good.)</li>

            <ul>
              <li>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>'s
                "--test-uplink" mode, I now print out a little of the
                downlink lists in more human-friendly form, but there's
                just <span style="font-style: italic;">so much</span>
                data that the effort of making it human-friendly---i.e.,
                printing it with descriptive headings and units, and
                scaled properly---is enormous.&nbsp; There are a couple
                of thousand data values in the complete collection of
                downlink lists (though, admittedly, with some overlap
                among the lists).&nbsp; I don't think I'll do much more
                of it right now.&nbsp; I have, however, organized the
                hooks for doing it into libyaAGC, so the effort isn't
                entirely wasted, and is potentially reusable by anyone
                who wants to complete the work.&nbsp; I'd be more
                excited about doing it myself, if I knew what the
                displays on the downlink-telemetry consoles in
                mission-control were supposed to look like.<br>
              </li>
              <li>I have added a couple of new commands (LMSIM and
                CMSIM) to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>/<span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> INI
                files.&nbsp; These commands tell the simulation whether
                it is supposed to be for an LM or a CM.&nbsp; (Odd that
                this hasn't been needed until now, isn't it?)&nbsp; The
                downlink lists for the LM and CM aren't distinguishable
                in some cases without this additional info.&nbsp; (They
                would have been distinguishable in real life, because
                the telemetry downlink hardware external to the CPU
                would have added this identfying info, I think.)<br>

                The digital uplink has now been implemented.&nbsp; I had
                to modify the description of it that I added to the
                developer page a few days ago, but not by much.</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>:&nbsp;
                I've added a new command-line switch,
                "--test-uplink".&nbsp; In this mode, <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> emits
                uplink-data when keys are pressed instead of emitting
                keycodes to its usual CPU input channel 015.&nbsp; This
                mode is very convenient for testing the digital uplink,
                since the uplink data consists of encoded DSKY keycodes
                anyhow.&nbsp; I've noticed that <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> is very lazy
                in updating the DSKY display when receiving uplink data;
                indeed, it may or may not update the display.&nbsp;
                However, in the absence of other data, I assume this is
                a normal property of the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">Luminary</span> and <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">Colossus</span> flight software, rather than a
                bug in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp;

                mode also prints messages when valid downlink data is
                detected, so I think it's fair to say that both the
                digital uplink and digital downlink are working properly
                now.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>&nbsp;

              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>:&nbsp; I
                now properly handle the DOWNRUPT interrupt
                request.&nbsp; The practical upshot of this is that the
                CPU is now emitting downlink telemetry and/or AEA
                initialization packets, whereas it was not doing so
                before.&nbsp; You can see the downlink in <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>, but
                it's just raw data on i/o channels 034 and 035, and so
                isn't very informative as of yet.<br>
              </li>
              <li>I rationalized the startup scripts somewhat.&nbsp; In
                particular, an <span style="font-weight: bold;">LM_Simulator</span>
                script is created during installation, and the other
                scripts (like <span style="font-weight: bold;">SimLuminary131</span>)
                call that script.&nbsp; This shouldn't matter much to
                anybody but me, I guess, but it allows <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>'s --debug
                switch to be used again with the scripts.&nbsp; Scripts

                can have up to three command-line arguments, the first

                one of which is passed to <span style="font-weight:

            occur that I can't figure out any way to stop, but it

                <li>To allow a free configuration (e.g. on/off) of
                  windows or different IP-Addresses to connect to yaAGC
                  an INI-File has been added (lm_system_simulator.ini)</li>
                <li>The window arrangement and content has been
                  optimized</li>
                <li>The IMU Coarse Align and IMU Fine Align is
                  implemented, although the last one does not work
                  correctly. (The counter is merely for very small
                  angles quite proportional to the given angle)</li>

            behavior of counter-registers CDUXCMD, CDUYCMD, CDUZCMD (and
            associated drive-enable bits in output channel 14) needed
            for continuing development of the IMU --- in this case, of
            IMU coarse alignment.&nbsp; Modified the description on the
            developer page of the description of channel 14 needed to
            use this feature, as well as the description of the CDUxCMD
            registers in the assembly-language manual page.&nbsp;

          <td style="vertical-align: top;"> In <span

            the <span style="font-family: monospace;">DVP</span>
            instruction according to an algorithm sent to me by Julian
            Webb.&nbsp; (Thanks, Julian!)&nbsp; I'm bound to say that
            there are a number of things that don't make sense about it
            to me, but it does manage to pass the self-test (which no
            algorithm I invented was able to do).&nbsp; Anyone who feels
            competent to do so is invited to examine the <span
              style="font-family: monospace;">DVP</span> instruction in
            the function <span style="font-family: monospace;">aea_engine</span>
            of the source file aea_engine.c, and give me your insights
            on the matter.&nbsp; Otherwise, though,&nbsp; <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span> now passes the
            built-in self-test (see, for example, p. 115 of Flight
            Program 8), and may therefore be cautiously considered as
            working.&nbsp; Probably there are plenty of problems with it
            that will surface slowly in the coming months.<br>

              <li>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>,
                implemented a fictitious output channel 0177 (see the <a
                  href="developer.html#Table_of_IO_Channels">developer
                  page</a>) which can be used for simplifying

              <li>In <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>,
                added the DISASSEMBLE, COUNTS, and PATTERN commands for
                debug-mode.&nbsp; Fixed the <span style="font-family:
                  monospace;">TIX</span> instruction, which was
                overwriting memory and causing the problem mentioned two
                days ago.&nbsp; But now I find that there is a
                fundamental problem in the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGS</span>/<span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDEDA</span>
                interaction through the socket interface; <span

                transmits data to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>
                upon a strobe from <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGS</span>,
                but there is not enough time between the strobe and the
                time the flight program checks the shift register for
                the data to be exchanged.&nbsp; Resolving this will take

                are the changes, as described by Stephan:</li>

            <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-style:
                italic;">Fixes:</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
              <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                <li>Unknown unprogrammed sequences as output of the
                  AGC/AGS are now handled (hopefully ;-))</li>
                <li>Improvement of the DSKY Lite by using real 7-Segment
                  numbers</li>
                <li>Remove of a trace (inserted for development) of an
                  internal timer which would fill up the Log-Out-Window</li>
                <li>Crew Button handling (AOT, Descent) corrected</li>
                <li>DSKY PRO button is now working</li>
                <li>Time printouts removed</li>
                <li>DSKY Labeling and Number Size as well as separation
                  lines corrected and added.</li>
                <li>Most important, the program now merely recognizes
                  AGC data packages with the following signature: 00...
                  01... 10... 11... So, the AGS packets shouldn't have a
                  negative impact any longer.<br>

              <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                <li>AGC Output has been completely revised. Now I'm
                  using text labels which will show the different state
                  of the signals.</li>
                <li>LM System Signals and Crew Buttons corrected. I'm
                  still unsure in some cases.</li>
              </ul>
              <span style="font-style: italic;">New Features:</span><br
                style="font-style: italic;">
              <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                <li>DSKY LITE is a very simple (awful graphics) but full
                  functioning DSKY. Due to your extensive description of
                  the interface it was quite simple to implement.</li>
                <li>IMU Simulation has been corrected and accelerated.
                  The angles are now running between 0\B0 and 360\B0 as
                  noted by the AGC.</li>
                <li>Simple RHC and THC as well as AOT buttons added</li>
                <li>Noun &amp; Verbs and first steps of the Tutorial
                  added.</li>
              </ul>
              The "DSKY LITE" is, I think, remarkably good, in spite of
              Stephan's badmouthing of the graphics.<br>

                is so new that it's in rapid flux.&nbsp; After it has

                After experimentation, it now has a lot more realistic
                default timestep for the numerical integration (6 hours

                Mr. Paul Fjeld has informed me that the digits in the
                DSKY simulation haven't been quite right.&nbsp; (In his
                words:&nbsp; "The digits on the [real] DSKY were unique
                and very cool.")&nbsp; Since Mr. Fjeld is both an artist
                and the Spacecraft Manager for LM-13 at the <a
                  href="http://www.cradleofaviation.org/exhibits/restorations/lem.html">
                  Cradle of Aviation Museum</a>, I'm inclined to believe
                him.&nbsp; Besides, he prepared an all-new set of images
                of the digits and sent them to me, thus saving me most
                of the work in changing them.&nbsp; So obviously, the
                appearances of the decimal digits have now changed in
                the software, and indeed, have changed pretty
                dramatically.&nbsp; (For now, though, I'll let all of
                the <span style="font-style: italic;">screenshots</span>
                on this website stay the way they are, so they're all a

              <li>Developer changes (normal functionality not
                affected):&nbsp; My original intention was that <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> would be
                developed in a way that was very independent of the
                peripheral devices (like the IMU and DSKY), and somewhat
                independent as well from the means of interfacing to the
                peripherals.&nbsp; Unfortunately, over time this idea
                became corrupted to the point that it really became
                impossible for developers to use anything other than the
                default socket-based interface (which I still
                recommend!), unless the <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaAGC</span> source code itself was hacked
                quite a lot.&nbsp; This has become unacceptable, since
                there are a number of groups adapting <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> to existing
                flight simulators, or other purposes, and all of this
                independent hacking will make it time-consuming to port
                improvements to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                into all of these efforts.&nbsp; Therefore:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>I have&nbsp; separated all socket-based code from
                  the offending source-code file (agc_engine.c), and
                  replaced it instead by a simple 3-function API that
                  should be usable for developing memory-mapped i/o
                  models, embedded AGC's, or other purposes, <span
                    style="font-style: italic;">without further
                    modification to agc_engine.c</span>.&nbsp;<br>
                </li>
                <li>I have created an embedded demonstration (i.e., of
                  an AGC as embedded firmware) based on a Motorola
                  Coldfire microcontroller, using an unmodified
                  agc_engine.c.<br>
                </li>
                <li>These concepts will be explained in detail on the <a
                    href="developer.html">developer page</a>, over the
                  next week or so, though no details are available there
                  yet.<br>

                (And speaking of improvements that need to be
                back-ported ...)&nbsp; I have noticed that although I
                provided all of the hooks for processing external
                triggers for counters (such as gimbal CDU counters), I
                did not actually implement them.&nbsp; In other words,
                if <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
                received a signal to increment a counter register, it
                would not actually do so.&nbsp; Hopefully this has been
                fixed.</li>

                249 (Apollo 8/9 CM) software listings have survived,
                since no other versions have turned up.&nbsp; However,
                Mr. Paul Fjeld has told me of the existence of 3
                additional AGC software versions, including (apparently)
                both the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Luminary</span>
                and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Colossus</span>
                versions used for Apollo 11.&nbsp; While I don't <span

              <li>Miscellaneous:&nbsp; The default Win32 install

                  bold;">yaAGC</span> and <span style="font-weight:
                  bold;">yaDSKY</span> has been changed (from
                /usr/local/bin) to c:/mingw/bin.&nbsp; This should let
                command-line switches like --core and --cfg work
                properly, instead of forcing full pathnames to be used
                with them.<br>

                The default <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
                graphical interface is far too big for any graphics
                resolution less than 1024×768.&nbsp; I've therefore now
                added another mode to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>,
                in which interface is only half as big.&nbsp; Use <span
                  style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>'s --half-size
                command-line switch to get the smaller interface.&nbsp;
                The smaller interface doesn't really look very good,
                because it is simply blindly scaled down from the larger
                interface, rather than being optimized, but at least
                it's usable at 800×600 and 640×480 resolutions.</li>

                percentage whilst waiting for --debug mode keystrokes,

            means that instructions like "<span style="font-family:

            when overflow is involved.<br>
            <br>
            ... Or else, it means that the description of control-pulses
            in Blair-Smith is not entirely accurate.&nbsp; It
            contradicts some later docs (like Smally), so this is
            possible.&nbsp; Must think more deeply ....<br>

              style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>'s handling of i/o
            channels was incorrect, in that it internally used the wrong
            numeric format for them, so none of them worked properly;
            moreover, while <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            read the virtual input port, it never actually wrote to the
            virtual output port (except in --debug-dsky mode).&nbsp; As

            <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>'s handling of
            the PRO key was wrong, in that the wrong bitflag was used
            for it.&nbsp; It looks like i/o channels are now handled
            correctly, not only in normal mode, but in --debug mode and
            in --debug-dsky mode.&nbsp; In experimenting with this, I
            noticed that it is impossible in --debug mode to ever find
            the PRO key pressed by checking "edit c32", because the PRO
            key sets this bit when the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
            key is pressed, and then clears the bit when released.&nbsp;
            Therefore, using "edit c32" will always find the bitflag
            associated with PRO cleared.&nbsp; But you can see that it
            works if you debug <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            itself with <span style="font-weight: bold;">gdb</span>.<br>

            the --debug mode of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            easier:<br>
            <ol>
              <li>The disassembler now shows opcodes for the
                implied-address instructions, like "<span
                  style="font-family: monospace;">SQUARE</span>" instead
                of "<span style="font-family: monospace;">MP A</span>"
                and "<span style="font-family: monospace;">RETURN</span>"
                instead of "<span style="font-family: monospace;">TC Q</span>".</li>
              <li>When <span style="font-family: monospace;">INDEX</span>
                is used with an instruction, the disassembler decodes
                and shows the instruction with the index added (along
                with a notation "w/i"), instead of leaving the user to
                deduce it.</li>
              <li>The timing used (i.e., the number of machine cycles in
                a given period of real-time) was messed up when --debug
                mode was used, since the time spent waiting at the
                debugger prompt was not accounted for.</li>
              <li>The timing also was not previously right with the
                --resume switch, since the time used prior to generating
                the core-dump wasn't accounted for.</li>
              <li>The construct <span style="font-family: monospace;">sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</span>
                is now used in place of <span style="font-family:
                  monospace;">CLK_TCK</span>.&nbsp; This is required for
                new compiler versions.&nbsp; I don't know if it will
                break under older compilers or not.&nbsp; I <span

            *.ini, Luminary131.bin, and Colossus249.bin to the
            installation directory (which is hard-coded as
            /usr/local/bin, so it's not totally perfect).&nbsp;
            Meanwhile, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> will now
            look in the installation directory for files specified with
            the --cfg and --core switches, if not found in the current
            directory.&nbsp; (These suggestions are due to Christian
            Bucher.)&nbsp; Also, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
            had not been displaying error messages when the file for
            --cfg wasn't found, and this has been corrected.&nbsp; The
            instruction "DXCH L", which is not unambiguously defined by
            the docs, has changed in a way that conforms to comments in
            the Luminary131 source.&nbsp; (Refer to address 33,03514, p.
            888.)&nbsp; Fixed a potential divide-by-0 in the DV
            instruction, but my impression is that my DV instruction
            right now is completely wrong anyhow.<br>
