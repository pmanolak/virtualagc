# This program is supposed to be able to take an assembly number 
# (from an assembly in the Apollo G&N system), and combine
# its find-table file (SOMETHING.csv) with the obligatory 
# drawings.csv file, producing a drawing drilldown from it.  
# The usage is:
#	./drilldown.py ASSEMBLY >ASSEMBLY.html
# where ASSEMBLY is something like 6015000-071 (drawing number
# plus configuration dash number) or else just a drawing number
# (without revision code in either case).  Additionally, the
# file
#	drilldown-ASSEMBLY.json
# is produced by this operation.  It has all of the same info that's
# in the HTML, plus quantities, except that the JSON doesn't provide
# any info about CAD transcriptions of the engineering drawings. 
#
# It's probably just as easy to look at the JSON itself, properly 
# formatted of course, to see what it provides, as opposed to my 
# giving a long explanation about it, but there are a couple of 
# points worth making.  What's in the JSON is a key/value dictionary,
# with the keys being the assemblies.  Thus, the top-level assembly
# will have the key ASSEMBLY, but all of the assemblies referenced
# by ASSEMBLY will be there, along with all those referenced by the 
# subassemblies, and so on.  The values for each of those assembly
# keys will also be key/value dictionaries, such as "parents" (which is
# a list of all assemblies using that assembly), but most of the keys
# will be the "FIND" numbers from the find tables in the drawings.
# The values for the FIND-number keys will themselves be dictionaries
# that describe the cell of the FIND-table that corresponds to that
# specific FIND-number row and the specific configuration-number column
# implied by the particular assembly.  The important characteristics of the
# cell are the keys
#	QTY		The quantity count.  Sometimes these may be "AR"
#			(for "as required") or "X" (for reference materials
#			like the schematic diagram, which aren't anything
#			used to actually build the assembly).
#	DRAWING		The subassembly or component associated with that
#			cell.  This is actually an array, though usually
#			only with one element in it, because any given cell
#			could actually call out several alternative 
#			subassemblies or components.  If a particular
#			entry is not present elsewhere in the JSON, it 
#			means either that it was a component (rather than 
#			an assembly), or else the FIND-table needed for the
#			drilldown has not yet been turned into a .csv file,
#			or that we don't have a revision of the drawing that's
#			new enough to contain the sought-after dash number.
#			It sometimes happens that as description of how to
#			determine the part number appears rather than the 
#			part number itself, such as "SEE NOTE 13".
#	TITLE		The title of the drawing associated with the assembly.
#			These come directly from the title blocks of the 
#			scanned drawings, where possible, but come from the
#			FIND tables if we don't actually have the scanned
#			drawing.
#	URL		An array of URLs associated with the DRAWING array.
#			These point to the scanned engineering drawings.
#			If a URL is blank, it means we don't have a scan
#			of the drawing.  URLs are provided even if the
#			particular configuration dash-number being sought
#			is not present in the scanned drawing, usually due
#			to the drawing being too early a revision.
#	CELL		This is simply the contents of the FIND-table cell,
#			as-is.  It usually looks like a QTY or DRAWING, but
#			is not always.  It's really just present for debugging
#			purposes, so use it for anything else at your peril!
