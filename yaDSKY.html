                  a DSKY?</big><br>
              </small></h2>
            The DSKY is the "display/keyboard" (DSKY) used by the Apollo
            Guidance Computer (AGC).&nbsp; The DSKY provided only a
            means to input keyboard data to the AGC, or to display
            visual information at command of the AGC, and therefore had
            little or no functionality of its own, when considered as a
            stand-alone device.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The&nbsp; DSKY may seem somewhat familiar from, for example,
            the movie <span style="font-style: italic;">Apollo 13</span>.
            In the HBO mini-series, <span style="font-style: italic;">From
the
















              Earth to the Moon</span>, the DSKY appears so prominently
            that it almost becomes another character (dramatically
            speaking). For those of us who are familiar with it from
            these sources, it is easy to think of the DSKY itself as
            being the computer.&nbsp; However, the DSKY really was quite
            independent from the AGC.&nbsp; From the computer's
            standpoint, the DSKY was just another few i/o channels, more
            or less, as in the block diagram below. </td>

          <br>
          <div align="left">One thing you may wonder about if you looked
            at the pictures above in a particularly scrutinizing fashion
            is this:&nbsp; Why, in the half-dozen or so pictures of the
            DSKY above, are there four or five different collections of
            words displayed on the upper-left panel of the DSKY?&nbsp;
            Or perhaps you didn't even notice, since people are so used
            to graphical displays that simply show whatever the software
            requires ... so what difference does it make <i>what</i>
            they display?&nbsp; Except that the DSKY didn't have a
            graphical display.&nbsp; Its design long preceded the notion
            of a useful graphical display.&nbsp; The words shown on the
            DSKY's front panel were actually engraved on there.&nbsp;
            They couldn't just change at the whim of software!&nbsp; Not
            only that, although it may not be obvious in the images
            above, some of the keyboards differed, in that some of them
            had a key labeled PRO, while others had a key labeled STBY.<br>
            <br>
            <img src="compareDSKY.png" alt="" width="412" height="218"
              align="left">Perhaps the point still isn't clear even
            after that explanation, so look at the image to the left,
            which I've extracted DSKY annunciator-lamp arrangements from
            the various images above.&nbsp; The two leftmost
            arrangements of annunciator lamps were actually never flown
            at all ... although if you squint <i>very</i> closely at
            the October 1966 photo of a Command Module control panel
            above, you'll see that the leftmost arrangement of
            annunciator lamps does seem to have been used in its
            DSKY.&nbsp; With that said, the rightmost arrangement was
            invariably used in the flown Command Modules, and was used
            in the Lunar Module up through Apollo 10, while beginning
            with Apollo 11 a different arrangement (not depicted) began
            to be used in the Lunar Module.&nbsp; By the way, I once
            asked Eldon Hall what the leftmost arrangement was actually
            used for, since it was never flown, but nevertheless still
            appears quite often in print articles?&nbsp; He simply said
            that the faces were modular, and thus interchangeable,
            leaving me the impression he thought I was an idiot.&nbsp;
            (But I think the question is still valid.&nbsp; <img
              src="smiley.png" alt="" width="16" height="16">)<br>
            <br>
            In fact, what this illustrates is that "the DSKY" is not
            just one thing, but rather a sequence of stages of a design
            process.&nbsp; Occasionally, people take me to task for
            ignoring such details, not to mention other specifics like
            the exact dimensions of the DSKY, the exact colors of the
            faceplate or the indicator lamps, and so forth, simply
            because such details were not available when I began the
            project of simulating the AGC and DSKY in software.&nbsp;
            Fair enough, though I'm going to basically continue ignoring
            such details below.&nbsp; Before I revert to doing that,
            though, I'd like to point out that we <i>now</i> have quite
            a collection of the original engineering drawings that
            define the DSKY design, so many of these questions can be
            answered by the engineering drawings rather than requiring a
            trip to the Smithsonian with calipers and whatever device is
            used to measure color.&nbsp; In fact, here are links to the
            engineering drawings for all Block II DSKYs flown on
            missions:<br>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="2003994-011.html">Apollo 5 LM</a></li>
              <li><a href="2003994-031.html">Apollo 7-8 CM, Apollo 9 LM</a></li>
              <li><a href="2003994-051.html">Apollo 9 CM</a></li>
              <li><a href="2003994-121.html">Apollo 10-17 CM, Skylab CM,
                  ASTP CM, Apollo 10 LM</a></li>
              <li><a href="2003994-091.html">Apollo 11-17 LM</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Which still leaves my question to Eldon Hall unanswered,
              about where the leftmost arrangement of indicator lamps
              was used?&nbsp; So I actually have dug into the
              engineering drawings a bit.&nbsp; The questionable
              arrangement of the DSKY's indicator lamps appears in <a
                href="2014999-011.html">the very earliest Block II
                G&amp;N (Guidance &amp; Navigation) system, which was
                designated G&amp;N system #201</a>, and specifically in
              <a href="SCDs/scd_1006316-.pdf">drawing 100631</a><a>6</a>,
              entitled "INDICATOR, ALARM, SPECIFICATION CONTROL
              DRAWING".&nbsp; In fact, it was even used in the unmanned
              Apollo 5 mission ... sort of.&nbsp; Since Apollo 5 was
              unmanned, it didn't really have much of a need for a
              display/keyboard unit, at least not insofar as interfacing
              to a non-existent astronaut was concerned.&nbsp; MIT/IL
              drawings (look at the table column labeled "603" in <a
                moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://archive.org/details/apertureCardBox471NARASW_images/page/n1892/mode/1up?view=theater">this


                drawing of the as-delivered systems</a>) indicate that
              the G&amp;N system #603 eventually used in Apollo 5's LM-1
              was delivered to NASA without any DSKY at all.&nbsp;
              However, that didn't stop the intrepid folks at NASA from
              installing a DSKY anyway.&nbsp; Interestingly, though, the
              DSKY NASA installed changed over time.&nbsp; The master
              drawing (6014999) tabulates NASA's modifications to
              MIT/IL's as-delivered G&amp;N systems.&nbsp; That master
              drawing went through a <i>lot</i> of revisions, but what
              it shows insofar as the DSKY for LM-1 is concerned is
              this:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>60014999 Revs 1, A:&nbsp; DSKY model 2003985-031,
                which has the mysterious arrangement of indicator lamps
                we were wondering about!&nbsp; And a STBY key on the
                keypad.<br>
              </li>
              <li>60014999 Revs B through AC:&nbsp; DSKY model
                2003985-051, which superficially looks the same.<br>
              </li>
              <li>60014999 Revs AD through AF:&nbsp; DSKY model
                2003950-011, which begins to have the "modern"
                arrangement of only 10 indicator lamps, but still with a
                STBY key.<br>
              </li>
              <li>60014999 Revs AG through DP:&nbsp; DSKY model
                2003994-011, which finally begins to have a PRO key
                rather than a STBY key.<br>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>So in the end, the mystery arrangement was never flown
              after all.&nbsp; Given that it took me roughly 20 years to
              come up with this answer, I guess I can forgive Eldon for
              not knowing the answer off the top of his head.<br>
            </p>
            <p>These drawings (and others like them for other variations
              of the G&amp;N system) are also full of other details of
              interest to those more concerned about authenticity of
              physical appearances than I am, such as that the indicator
              lamps shall be "aviation white" and "aviation yellow" per
              <a href="Documents/assist.dla.mil/MIL_C_25050A.pdf">mil-spec













                MIL-C-25050</a>.&nbsp; One interesting factoid asserted
              by the drawing is that the lettering shall be 0.156" high
              black Gorton Condensed.&nbsp; Other versions of the DSKY
              instead call out Gorton Normal.&nbsp; You may suppose from
              this that "Gorton" was some generally recognized
              font.&nbsp; It was not.&nbsp; Gorton was in fact the name
              of a manufacturer of engraving machines.&nbsp; However, <a
                href="https://github.com/ehdorrii/dsky-fonts">Gene Dorr
                (who is actually the one who researched these matters)
                has gone ahead and created an actual Gorton font</a>,
              which could be of use to anyone trying to create their
              own, far more authentic-looking version of a DSKY than I
              have!&nbsp; <br>
            </p>
            <p>As for G&amp;N system #201, I suppose that it was simply
              such an early version that the specific indicator lamps
              needed hadn't been set in stone yet, but that once the
              media had an attractive graphic it simply ended up being
              reproduced in print articles.&nbsp; As far as the middle
              arrangement shown above, I find no record of it in any of
              the engineering drawings I've seen.<br>

          height="200" align="right"></a>yaDSKY</span> is a computer
    program which emulates the DSKY.&nbsp; <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaDSKY</span> has now been superceded by <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY2</span>, though both programs
    are still available, at least in principle, and with only minor
    differences are interchangeable.&nbsp; So in speaking of "yaDSKY" I
    am really speaking of either program unless I explicitly state
    otherwise.<br>
    <br>
    The DSKY had little or no functionality of its own, when considered
    as a stand-alone device.&nbsp; The same is true of the <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> emulation of the
    DSKY.&nbsp; It requires the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
    program (which simulates the AGC) to be useful. &nbsp;&nbsp; Just as
    the true AGC and DSKY communicated between themselves by means of
    wiring, the virtual <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
    and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> communicate
    between themselves using communication channels (sockets) that act
    like virtual wires.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> merely communicates
    keypresses to <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>, and
    receives communications from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
    about which lights to activate.<br>
    <br>
    If you don't like my <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>,
    or if you want to integrate <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
    into a larger simulation project, or if you want something that
    works on a platform I don't support, you can replace <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> with a program more to
    your liking. The method for doing so is described in detail on the <a
      href="developer.html">developer-info page</a>.&nbsp; In fact,
    Stephan Hotto has done just that (among other things) with the <a

    <p>Usually you <i>don't</i> directly run <b>yaDSKY2</b>!&nbsp;
      Rather, you run the convenient desktop app which I call the <b>VirtualAGC</b>
      GUI, and it runs <b>yaAGC</b>, <b>yaDSKY2</b>, and whatever
      other programs you need from our software suite that would be
      irksome to figure out for yourself.<br>

    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
      and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> are a
      client/server pair, and can be running on the same computer or on
      different computers. In order to connect to the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> server, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> has to know the
      IP-address of the machine on which <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">yaAGC</span> is running. By default this is
      "localhost"—i.e., the two are running on the same computer.
      However, a different IP address may be specified using this
      command-line switch. In Linux, this may be either the machine's
      name, or else a numerical address in dotted format (n.n.n.n).
      MS-Windows—at least Windows 98—is somewhat crippled in this
      respect, and will only accept a host name rather than a numerical
      IP address.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --port=<span style="font-style: italic;">port</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Similarly (see above), in addition
      to an IP address, a port number is needed. This must be in the
      range of port numbers <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
      is scanning (which by default is 19697-19706).&nbsp; If no port is
      specified, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> will
      use 19697 (since the Apollo 11 mission was in July 1969). A
      simulation of the Command Module would require <span
        style="font-style: italic;">two</span> DSKY units, one for the
      contral panel and one for the navigator's station; so two copies
      of <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> would be run,
      and would have to be assigned different ports (such as 19697 and
      19698).&nbsp; The <a href="developer.html">developer page</a>
      contains <span style="font-style: italic;">suggested</span> port
      assignments, including the suggestion that Colossus should use the
      range 19697-19706 while Luminary should use the range 19797-19806.<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    --cfg=<span style="font-style: italic;">ConfigFilename</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> This switch configures the DSKY for
      different Apollo missions or for CM vs. LM operation.&nbsp; Among
      the things that differ in different configurations are the legends
      that appear on the 14 indicator lights on the upper-left side of
      the DSKY panel, and the labeling on the PRO key.&nbsp; The DSKY is
      reconfigured through the use of configuration files, of which the
      ones that exist as of this writing are CM0.ini, CM.ini, LM.ini,
      and LM1.ini.&nbsp; (A description of the differences appears
      later.)&nbsp; If no "--cfg" switch is present, default values are
      used which are the same as those in the distribution version of
      LM.ini, but the LM.ini file itself is not used unless specified by
      the presence of "--cfg=LM.ini".&nbsp; Refer to the <a
        href="developer.html">developer page</a> for information on
      modifying the legend sets or adding new sets. &nbsp; If a complete
      pathname for <span style="font-style: italic;">ConfigFilename</span>
      is not specified, then <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
      will look first in the current directory, and then (for software
      versions 05/06/2004 or later) in the installation directory (which
      is /usr/local/bin by default, but which may be changed at
      build-time).<br>

    </div>
    --half-size<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> (Only versions 20040811 and
      after.)&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>'s
      graphical interface is simply too big for PC's with lower
      graphical resolution (smaller than 1024×768).&nbsp; If the
      --half-size switch is used, half-size graphics are used, and so
      the interface should be usable even down to 640×480
      resolutions.&nbsp; The smaller interface doesn't really look very
      good, because it is simply blindly scaled down from the larger
      interface, rather than being optimized, but at least it's usable
      at 800×600 and 640×480 resolutions.&nbsp; If both the --half-size
      and --cfg switches are used, the --half-size switch must be to the
      left of the --cfg switch on the command line.<br>
      <br>

    --delay=<span style="font-style: italic;">Milliseconds</span><br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> (Versions 20040821 and

        style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> does not immediately
      begin attempting to communicate with <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">yaAGC</span>.&nbsp; The current defaults are 0 ms. in
      Linux and 500 ms. in Win32.&nbsp; This "feature" has been added as
      a temporary work-around for <a href="buglist.html">problem report</a>
      #23, and probably has no other sensible purpose.&nbsp; Even on
      Win32 it isn't usually needed, but it's here for the 10% (or
      whatever) of the time it's needed.<br>

    <br>
    --debug-counter-mode<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> (Versions 20050515 and
      after.)&nbsp; This is present only for debugging the AGC's
      "unprogrammed" counter-increments, and has no useful purpose
      otherwise.&nbsp; In this mode, the keys of the simulated DSKY—or
      at least, the VERB, NOUN, 0-7, and PRO keys—do not have their
      normal interpretations and cannot be used to affect the AGC CPU in
      any normal way.&nbsp; Instead, the combination NOUN-<span
        style="font-style: italic;">digit</span>-<span
        style="font-style: italic;">digit</span> is used to specify an
      (octal) CPU counter-register number, and the combination VERB-<span
        style="font-style: italic;">digit</span> is used to select a
      counter-increment type as defined on the <a
        href="developer.html#sendrecv_Protocol">developer</a> <a
        href="developer.html#sendrecv_Protocol">page</a>.&nbsp; The PRO
      key is used to send the selected counter-increment command to the
      AGC, to increment/decrement the counter-register.&nbsp; Note that
      there are no visual displays associated with this, since the AGC
      is still commanding the DSKY visual display in its usual way, so
      you just have to mentally keep track of what counter-register and
      which unprogrammed-increment command you've chosen.&nbsp; This
      mode is terminated only by restarting <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">yaDSKY</span>.&nbsp; Only counter registers in the range
      32-60 (octal, default 32) are accepted, and only increment-types
      in the range 0-6 (default 1) are accepted.&nbsp; Any time the PRO
      key is pressed with settings outside this range, no action
      occurs.&nbsp; The only useful way to use this is to make sure that
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> has been run in
      debug mode, and to use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>
      debugger's "dump" command to check the results of the various
      increment/decrement commands.&nbsp; For example, if the default
      settings aren't changed, the command "dump 32" will initially show
      00000, but will show "00001" after the PRO key has been hit once,
      "00002" after the PRO key has been hit twice, and so on.<br>

    <a name="TestUplink" id="TestUplink"></a>--test-uplink<br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> (Versions 20050626 and
      after.)&nbsp; In this mode, keystrokes are communicated to <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> via the digital uplink
      rather than via the normal CPU input channel 015, but this is
      relatively transparent to the user, other than the fact that the
      UPLINK ACTY indicator lights up.&nbsp; Normally this facility
      would have been used by the ground-station for uplinking
      data.&nbsp; However, since the uplink consists of encoded DSKY
      keycodes, "--test-uplink" provides a convenient method of testing
      this facility without having to write a whole new program.&nbsp;
      I've noted that when using this mode, the keystrokes seem to work
      properly, but updating the DSKY display is very
      hit-and-miss.&nbsp; I assume this is a normal property of the
      uplink—rather than a bug in <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>—but
I
















      don't really know.&nbsp;<br>

      versions 20050628 and after.&nbsp; Not available in <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY2</span>, but equivalent
      functionality is provided instead by the <a
        href="yaTelemetry.html">separate <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">yaTelemetry</span> program</a>.)&nbsp; In this mode, <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span> provides the additional
      function of displaying telemetry-downlink lists as they are
      emitted from the AGC, in a manner similar to the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">yaTelemetry</span> program.&nbsp; To
      use this mode effectively, <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY</span>
      should be run from a terminal window which is at least 80
      text-columns wide, and at least 36 text-rows high; otherwise, a
      complete downlink list will not fit on-screen and portions will
      scroll off the top of the screen.&nbsp; Furthermore, an ANSI
      terminal will provide the most effective (and attractive) display,
      since some ANSI escape-sequences are used for cursor
      positioning.&nbsp; In Linux this should be no problem.&nbsp; In
      Windows, it is generally necessary to install ANSI.SYS in order
      for the command-line interface to accept ANSI commands.&nbsp; I
      must admit, though, that in experimenting with Windows XP I have
      been unable to get ANSI.SYS to install.&nbsp; (If somebody wants
      to send me the magic formula for this, I'd appreciate it.)<br>

    Other than the techniques discussed in this section, it may be
    possible to use the <a
      href="yaTelemetry.html#Scripted_operation_for_tutorials_museum">digital
uplink
















      facility</a> to automate various activities.<br>
    <h3><a name="Canned_Pre-recorded_Mission_Segments"></a> Canned,
      Pre-recorded Mission Segments</h3>
    <p>(This section is applicable to software versions 2017-12-11 or
      later.)<br>
    </p>
    <p>It is possible to record (or otherwise create) a script of AGC
      i/o-channel operations controlling the DSKY, and to conveniently
      play back such canned scripts later.&nbsp; At present, there are
      two ways of obtaining such canned scripts:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Record" them using <b>yaDSKY2</b> (or <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/piPeripheral/piDSKY2.py">piDSKY2.py</a>).&nbsp;
The
















        recording process is described below.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Obtain a log of i/o-channel activity from a NASSP simulation,
        and convert that log to DSKY format using the program <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/piPeripheral/convertNasspLog.py">convertNasspLog.py</a>.&nbsp;
The
















        ability for NASSP to log this data is new, and presumably
        neither documented nor widely available, so the details are TBD.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In playback, <b>yaDSKY2</b> basically disregards any new
      output-channel commands originating from the AGC in real time,
      working only from the script it is playing back.&nbsp; When the
      script has completed or perhaps has been prematurely terminated by
      the user, it restores the DSKY's numerical displays and indicator
      lamps to the configuration they had prior to starting the
      playback, and resumes listening to the AGC for new commands.&nbsp;
      Usually the AGC commands that were ignored during script-playback
      will have been buffered and will all be processed instantly, so
      that the DSKY will quickly assume the appearance it would have had
      if it had been responding to the AGC's commands all along.<br>
    </p>
    <p>At the moment I'm writing this, we have the following
      pre-recorded scripts, each taking 15-16 minutes to run:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An Apollo 8 launch sequence.</li>
      <li>An Apollo 11 launch sequence.</li>
      <li>An Apollo 11 lunar landing sequence.&nbsp; Note that since
        this is a recording of a simulated landing, and not a recording
        from the actual Apollo 11 landing, you shouldn't imagine that
        events (like 12<i>xx</i> alarms) necessarily happen at the same
        times or in the same ways.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To select a script to play back, click the <b>yaDSKY2</b>'s PROG
      indicator lamp with the mouse.&nbsp; Of course, in a real DSKY,
      the PROG indicator and all other indicators are simply lamps, and
      <i>not</i> buttons, and it's only the simulated DSKY in which some
      indicators have been subverted to have button-like
      properties.&nbsp; At any rate, doing so opens up a file-dialog
      that allows you to select the canned script to be played
      back.&nbsp; Usually these will be in the directory the file dialog
      shows by default, though if you have created canned scripts of
      your own, they will be located elsewhere and you'll have to use
      the file dialog to navigate to them.&nbsp; The files have the
      extension ".canned".<br>
    </p>
    <p>Scripts will generally execute all the way to their ends,
      displaying a pop-up information box when complete, but you can
      also prematurely terminate a script by once again clicking PROG
      whilst the script is running.<br>
    </p>
    <p>A script is simply a text file, and therefore can in theory be
      created by some other method than the ones I will proceed to
      describe below.&nbsp; The format is very simple; each line simply
      has three fields,<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><i><tt>DifferentialTimeInMilliseconds
          AgcOutputChannelNumberInOctal AgcOutputChannelValueInOctal</tt></i><br>
    </blockquote>
    The differential time (usually an integer, but can be floating-point
    decimal) is simply the time in milliseconds since the preceding line
    of the file.&nbsp; (NASSP i/o-channel logs have the same format,
    except that the initial field is the absolute simulation time, in
    seconds.)&nbsp; DSKYs are always controlled by AGC "output channels"
    010, 011, 013, and 0163 as described on <a href="developer.html">our
developer
















      page</a>; for informational purposes, <i>input</i> channels that
    record keystrokes (outputs from the DSKY) are generally included as
    well.<br>
    <br>
    To record a file from <b>yaDSKY2</b> (or piDSKY2.py) for later
    playback, you'd do this:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Using <b>yaDSKY2</b>.&nbsp; Left-click the TRACKER indicator
        lamp with the mouse to start recording, and then click it again
        to finish the recording.&nbsp; On Linux, the output file,
        "yaDSKY2-recorded.canned" goes into the home directory.&nbsp;
        I'm not sure where it goes on Windows or Mac (perhaps the
        Documents directory).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Using the Python 3 language DSKY simulation, piDSKY2.py, with
        its --record command-line switch, everything is simply recorded
        without additional user interaction, and the recording continues
        until piDSKY2.py is terminated.&nbsp; The output file,
        "piDSKY2-recorded.canned" goes onto the (Raspberry Pi) Desktop.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Finally, it is sometimes useful to analyze these i/o-channel
      script in order to understand or document what they're
      doing.&nbsp; There's a program called <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/piPeripheral/humanizeScript.py">humanizeScript.py</a>
      that produces a relatively human-friendly report from a playback
      script.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="Special_Effects"></a>"Special Effects"</h3>
    If you should find yourself in the position to give a presentation
    on the AGC, the lunar landings, Apollo, etc., using Virtual AGC,
    versions of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY2</span>
    program 20090613 and later have a "special effects" facility build
    into it which might be useful to give your presentation a little
    more sizzle.&nbsp; Conceivably, this facility could also be used in
    setting up an interactive AGC demo, AGC self-study materials,
    etc.&nbsp; What the facility allows you to do is to map selected
    sequences of DSKY keystrokes to commands which will be executed on
    the computer running the simulation.&nbsp; The only real
    restrictions are that the key-sequences used must begin with the
    VERB key and cannot contain a second VERB key in the sequence; also,
    at most 100 keypad-to-command mappings can be defined.<br>
    <br>
    This keystroke-to-command mapping is independent of the processing
    done by the AGC.&nbsp; In other words, if a certain keystroke
    pattern is configured to execute a certain command on the simulating
    computer, it will <span style="font-style: italic;">still</span>
    cause the AGC to perform whatever action the AGC would normally
    perform given those keystrokes.<br>
    <br>
    In order to configure <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY2</span>
    to do this, you need to create a file called "DSKY2.matches" in the
    Resources/ subfolder of the installation folder.&nbsp; (We discuss
    this elsewhere, but for default installations that folder is
    "~/VirtualAGC/Resources/" in Linux, "c:\program files\virtual
    agc\resources" in Windows, and
    "~/Desktop/VirtualAGC.app/Contents/Resources/" in Mac OS X.)&nbsp;
    This ASCII file is simply a sequence of lines which begin with the
    keystroke pattern being matched, followed by a space, followed by
    the command which is supposed to be executed.&nbsp; The command can
    have spaces or pathnames in it.&nbsp; The patterns are created from
    the characters VN+-0123456789CPKER (capitalization is important!),
    which correspond to the DSKY keys in an obvious way (see the
    following section).&nbsp; The pattern must begin with V and contain
    no more than one V, since the match buffer is cleared whenever the
    VERB key is pressed.&nbsp; You can also use the special pattern
    "startup", in which the associated command is executed when <span
      style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY2</span> starts up rather than
    having to be activated by any particular sequence of keystrokes.<br>
    <br>
    Basically, anything which can be controlled from the computer's
    command-line can be controlled by a DSKY key sequence in this
    way.&nbsp;&nbsp; What these things are depends on the operating
    system, the peripherals installed on your computer, and the ease of
    controlling those peripherals from command-lines (as opposed to GUI
    controls)—not to mention your own creativity and computer skills—so
    I won't bother with listing any specific commands you might
    use.&nbsp; But in a general way, you might:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Initiate playback of audio clips.</li>
      <li>Initiate playing of a CD or DVD.</li>
      <li>Cause a text window to pop up.</li>
      <li>etc.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    For example, suppose that your PC was configured so that it could
    control an X10 automation system which could (among other things)
    turn off the room lights by executing the command-line command
    "LightsOff.bat", and that to begin your presentation you wanted to
    turn off the room lights and start a short introductory video; later
    in the presentation you want to manually demonstrate some AGC
    operations, and you want to trigger some special action when
    performing a "goto pooh" operation ("V37E00E").&nbsp;&nbsp; As
    mentioned, the V37E00E command is still processed properly by the
    AGC and still causes program P00 to start.&nbsp; For this example,
    your DSKY2.matches file might look like this:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">startup LightsOff.bat<br>
        startup PlayIntroVideo.bat<br>
        V37E00E GotoPoohAction.bat</span><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    This example assumes that you are running Windows (since that's the
    only place that a ".bat" file is used; on other supported platforms,
    the equivalent concept would be a "shell script").&nbsp; You provide
    the batch files yourself, and <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaDSKY2</span>
    has no understanding at all of what they represent, other than that
    it is supposed to execute them.&nbsp; This example needs only a
    single keystroke mapping, but if there were additional keystroke
    mappings, you would simply add more lines to the file.&nbsp; Also,
    while we illustrate this with batch files (shell scripts), the
    commands could just as easily be executable programs with
    command-line parameters as well.<br>
    <br>
    It's very important to understand that <span style="font-weight:
      bold;">yaDSKY2</span> has no means of locating the commands
    referenced by DSKY2.matches other than the the local rules (such as
    the PATH environment variable) used by your system.&nbsp;
    Furthermore, the setting of PATH isn't necessarily the same when you
    are running <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span> by
    clicking its desktop icon than it is when you are testing out batch
    files or shell scripts from a command line.&nbsp; Therefore, it may
    be best to specify the full pathnames of the commands being used
    rather than just the simple filenames as shown in the example
    above.&nbsp; Personally, I place these command files in the same
    folder as DSKY2.matches itself, and specify the names as "./<span
      style="font-style: italic;">filename</span>" or ".\<span
      style="font-style: italic;">filename</span>".<br>
    <br>
    In the future, this facility could be extended in various ways, such
    as triggering commands based on the DSKY indicator lamps becoming
    active, numerical patterns appearing in the DSKY display registers,
    adding commands for initiating digital uplinks, etc.&nbsp; However,
    it is unlikely that any of these capabilities will be implemented
    unless there are explicit requests for them, so contact me directly
    if you have a need for some or all of them.<br>

      the DSKY</h2>
    It's important to understand that the various keys and displays of
    the DSKY have no intrinsic interpretations of their own.&nbsp; The
    interpretations of the keys and displays are entirely dictated by
    the software running on the AGC; with different AGC software,
    different interpretations might apply.&nbsp; Fortunately, though,
    the software was fairly consistent in this regard, and the typical
    meanings of the keys and displays are summarized below.<br>

            the astronaut decides when to see what the computer is
            waiting to display; whereas for PRIO DISP, the computer
