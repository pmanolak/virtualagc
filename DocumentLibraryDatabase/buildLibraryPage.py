# Filename:     buildLibraryPage.py
# Purpose:	    Builds a Virtual AGC Project "document library" web page from
#               a database of documents stored on the site. 
# Mod history:  2021-09-08 RSB  Began
#               2021-09-11 RSB  Added some database conveniences:  For the 
#                               Authors, the strings ", and " and " and "
#                               are now automatically replaced by ", ".
#                               Also, ", Jr" is replaced by " Jr".
#                               For the date fields, "MM/YYYY" and "YYYY"
#                               are now accepted, rather than insisting
#                               on "??/??/????".  I had already added
#                               the convenience of optional "M", "D", and "YY"
#                               rather than insisting on "??", "??", and "YYYY"
#               2021-09-12 RSB  Simplified the code for parsing simple lists
#                               and name/org lists, extended it to all 
#                               fields that could benefit from it, including
#                               handling of comma vs %44, slash vs %47,
#                               and ", Jr".  More importantly, it's actually
#                               generating a lot more of the web-page now.
#               2021-09-20 RSB  First fully-functional version, I think.
#               2021-10-27 RSB  Added "ACB-" document-number prefix for 
#                               ACB requests.
#               2022-01-18 RSB  Added the Study Guides section.
#               2022-07-03 RSB  Tracked whether or not items are categorized
#                               (as opposed to merely appearing in the 
#                               Everything section).
#		        2022-10-29 RSB	Expanded "Software Listings" section to 
#				                "Software Listings and Dumps".
#		        2022-11-01 RSB	Added --shuttle command-line switch to 
#				                process shuttle documents rather than
#				                main document library.
#               2022-11-23 RSB  Added the "Administrative" section to the 
#                               Shuttle library.
#               2022-11-28 RSB  Added OI-specific sections to the Shuttle
#                               library.
#               2023-07-31 RSB  Added shorthand STS-nnn-mmm to Targets field.
#               2023-08-01 RSB  Added the "Flight STS-xxx" sections for --shuttle.
#               2023-11-24 RSB  Corrected many STS flight titles.
#               2024-02-28 RSB  Added section for flight software
#                               user notes and requirements waivers.
#
# Usage:
#	./buildLibraryPage.py <DocumentLibraryDatabase.tsv >../links2.html
# or
#	./buildLibraryPage.py --shuttle <ShuttleLibraryDatabase.tsv >../links-shuttle.html
#
# Up to this point (2021-09-08), the document-library page (links.html) has
# been a manually-maintained HTML file. That worked fine 18 years ago when
# there was little on the page other than the 100 or so documents that had
# been on the now-defunct HRST website.  Nowadays, when there's more like
# 3000 documents, and there are days when 100+ are added on that day alone,
# it's much tougher to manage.  Some points of difficulty are that documents
# can get categorized oddly, wherein they're stuck in unusual sections of the
# page and are hard to find.  They're also hard to move, since doing so
# (in Mozilla Composer, the only satisfactory WYSIWYG HTML editor I know), 
# because Composer keeps changing the links to ones on the local drive, which
# you have to remember to fix.  And then there's the NEW icon I stick next to
# newly-added files; and it doesn't help!  So I want a much more flexible way
# to be able to restructure the document-library page and to have better ways
# of finding what I want to find on it.
#
# The whole thing depends on a "database", which I'm maintaining as a Google
# Sheet on the cloud, called "Virtual AGC Document Library Database", and 
# which is supposed to be exported as a TSV file from time to time, and 
# kept in DocumentLibraryDatabase/DocumentLibraryDatabase.tsv, along with
# this script, DocumentLibraryDatabase/buildLibraryPage.py.  The idea is that
# this script is run, from time to time, to regenerate the document-library
# page.
#
# I may also eventually want to use the DocumentLibraryDatabase.tsv file
# to create a JSON file which can be embedded in a search page.  But that
# has nothing to do with this script, and I'm undecided anyway since I'm not
# sure that a search page would have any value added over the Google searchbar
# I now embed on every Virtual AGC web-page anyway.
#
# The TSV database is structured as follows, with one line per file (except 
# the top line, which is a header).  Note that the the characters "," and "/"
# have a special meaning in terms of parsing certain fields into sub-fields, so
# if a any such sub-field (such as an author name or a document number) contains
# a "," or "/" unrelated to the desired sub-fields, they should be replaced
# by the strings "%44" and "%47", respectively.  As a convenience, the 
# suffixes ", Jr" and ", Sr" can be used directly in Author names or Scanner
# names without having to resort to "%44".  Also, "/" is a natural part of 
# URLs, so they needn't be replaced by "%47".
#
#   Field 1     Date Added.  This is an optional field of the form MM/DD/YYYY,
#               which indicates the date when the document file was added to
#               the library.  This used for automatically determining which
#               document files are newly added and therefore need to be
#               displayed to the user differently.  If the field is empty,
#               then the document file's filesystem timestamp is used instead.
#               Actually, we always use the later of the DateAdded and file
#               timestamps when collating, since obviously the file couldn't
#               have been added before it existed.
#
#   Field 2     Document Date.  This is supposed to reflect how the document
#               is internally dated.  The date format is one of the following,
#                   Year
#                   Month/Year
#                   Month/Day/Year
#               where Year is either YY or YYYY, Month is either M or MM, and
#               Day is either D or DD.  Also, any of these fields may consist
#               of question marks ("?", "??", "????"), which are then
#               automatically converted to one of the 3 patterns without 
#               question marks listed above.  A completely unknown date may
#               be entered as a single question mark.
#   Field 3     Document Number.  This is the document number originally assigned
#               back during Apollo, such as "R-567" or "LUMINARY Memo #125".
#               If there's more than one document number assigned to the same
#               document, such as "MSC12345" and "71-FM-8765", they are
#               separated by commas.  Usually the formatting of document 
#               numbers is peculiar to each organization doing it, so it is
#               helpful to designate the organization recognizing/assigning the
#               document number.  This can be done by suffixing the 
#               organization name to the document number, delimited by '/'.
#               For example, "R-567/IL, MSC5678/MSC" would mean that the
#               document had MIT Instrumentation Lab number R-567, but 
#               Manned Spacecraft Center number MSC5678. Here are some 
#               organization suffixes I've been using so far:
#                   IL          Instrumentation lab or Charles Stark Draper Lab
#                   AC          AC Electronics or Delco Electronics
#                   MSC         Manned Spacecraft Center or Johnson Space Center
#                   GAEC        Grumman
#                   NAA         North American Aviation (or Rockwell)
#                   TRW         TRW
#                   IBM         IBM Federal Systems Division
#                   NASA        NASA other than MSC
#                   Raytheon    Raytheon
#                   JPL         Jet Propulsion Laboratory
#                   Bellcomm
#                   Bendix
#               Note that the document numbers themselves cannot contain
#               '/' or ',', so if they do have those characters, remove or 
#               substitute them somehow.  My observation so far is that none
#               of the document numbers contain commas, and that only
#               about 0.1% of document numbers for Apollo contain a slash,
#               which I've simply replaced them with hyphens.
#
#   Field 4     Revision.  Empty for initial version or unknown.  I also 
#               sometimes put "Draft" or "Preliminary" as the revision level.
#
#   Field 5     Portion.  If the file contains the entire document, 
#               blank. But the file may be one of a multivolume set, or just 
#               some range of sections, or just a table, or some other portion 
#               of the entire document.  In that case, this field is a very 
#               concise description of the portion.
#               
#   Field 6     Authors.  If unknown, may be left blank, but I usually use
#               "Anonymous", simply as a maintenance feature to emphasize that
#               I actually checked it rather than just accidentally omitted
#               it.  If there are multiple authors, they can be 
#               comma-delimited.  If the authors are a part of 
#               some known organization, that affiliation can be appended with
#               a "/".  For example "Hugh Blair-Smith/IL, Jay Sampson/AC".
#               Actually, every individual should have an affiliation, even
#               if it's just "/" followed by nothing, and no corporate author
#               (such as "MIT Instrumentation Laboratory") should have an
#               affiliation.  That's because we use the affiliation to 
#               recognize which authors are individuals and which are 
#               corporates, and that affects sorting on author names.
#               Note that names must not contain commas, since commas delimit
#               the names; however, ", Jr" is an exception for 
#               convenience, in that it will be accepted without causing a 
#               break in the name.  Beyond that, "%44" can be placed within
#               a name, and will automatically be replaced by a ",".  For
#               example, "%44 Sr." in place of ", Sr.".
#               Also, if individual authors aren't listed
#               in the document, but the organization which created it can
#               be used as the author; for example, "MIT Instrumentation 
#               Laboratory", "AC Electronics", and so on.  Where the 
#               organization names changed over the course of the project
#               ("MIT Instrumentation Laboratory" becoming "Charles Stark
#               Draper Laboratory", "AC Electronics" perhaps appearing as
#               "Delco Electronics" or even "General Motors", "Manned 
#               Spacecraft Center" becoming "Johnson Space Center", etc.) I
#               generally just continue to use the one that came first or was
#               more commonly used.
#               
#
#   Field 7     Target.  The document may be targeted for things like specific
#                   Mission (AS-204, Apollo 7, etc)
#                   Spacecraft (LM-3, SC-012)
#                   Program names (COLOSSUS, LUMINARY, LUMINARY 1E)
#                   Program revision (COMARNCHE 55, LUMINARY 131 rev 1)
#               or some comma-delimited list.
#
#   Field 8     Keywords.  I have in mind examples like "Testing", 
#               "Simulation", "Software", "Hardware", "G&N", "Pad Load", 
#               "Erasable Memory Program", and so on, or any comma-delimited
#               list of keywords.  I doubt that the Target field and the 
#               Keywords field will be treated very differently, though, 
#               as they're both intended to provide ways to categorize the
#               files and thus segregate them appropriately in the document
#               library page.
#
#               The keyword "Blurb" is special. The entire record is always
#               ignored, except when printing out the "Recent Additions" 
#               section.  There, the Comment field is used as a blurb for that
#               day's sub-section. 
#
#   Field 9     Absolute URL to the file, for making hyperlinks.  If there's 
#               more than one available file, their URLs should be 
#               comma-delimited, and they should be arranged in order of 
#               most-preferable to least-preferable.  That's a subjective 
#               judgement, of course, but basically it comes down to 2 cases: 
#               If one file is of reasonably-comparable visual quality but is 
#               much smaller than the other, then it is preferable.  
#               Conversely, if the files are reasonably comparable in size but 
#               one is much-more-legible, then it is the preferable one.
#               Note that URLs must not contain commas, since commas delimit
#               the URL lists.  If a URL does contain a comma, replace it
#               with "%44"; the software will automatically convert this back
#               to a comma without it affecting how the URL lists are broken
#               up.  The actual URL in a hyperlink will have a comma.  There
#               are some factors built in for my own personal convenience,
#               in that "http://www.ibiblio.org/" and "^.*/sandroid.org/public_html/"
#               are both automatically replaced by "https://www.ibiblio.org/";
#               That so that I can cut-and-paste URLs from existing web pages
#               or from my local document stash without having to correct them
#               for onlin use.
#
#   Field 10    Title of the document or partial document; or failing that,
#               a reasonable description.
#
#   Field 11    ContributingArchive.  This is, of course, whoever we got the
#               document from, whether or not they provided much cooperation
#               in doing so.  For example, some common examples are Don Eyles,
#               MIT Museum, NARA-SW, UHCL, NTRS, etc.  The field can be
#               left empty --- certainly on a temporary basis --- but it would
#               be nice to know where some of this stuff came from.  
#               Unfortunately, in the old days I used to change the incoming
#               filenames (often, useless strings of random numbers) to 
#               meaningful description, and because of that I no longer can
#               trace them back to the source.  If there are multiple URLs 
#               in field 9, then there may be multiple archives here, 
#               comma-delimited, and in the same order as field 9.
#
#   Field 12    Scanner.  If some person freely scanned the documemt, or paid
#               to have it scanned, or transcribed it, then that person's 
#               name can be put here.  Or it can be left empty.  If there
#               are multiple URLs in field 9, then there may be multiple 
#               names here, comma-delimited, and in the same order as field 9.
#
#   Field 13    Unlucky field 13 is the Disclaimer.  This is hardly ever
#               necessary, but some archives require as a part of their terms
#               of service, that you pay obeisance to them using some 
#               formalized phrases which which they supply you, such as
#               "We praise the almighty XXX Archive for graciously allowing 
#               us to pay them a fee to show you this document, even though
#               their entire contribution to creating this public-domain
#		        document (paid for with our tax dollars) was nil,
#               and all they did was leave it sitting in a box for 30 years
#               after some reasonably famous person donated it to them."
#               Theoretically there could be multiple disclaimers if a given
#               document had multiple digitizations from different sources, 
#               however, we just lump them all into one big string.  It's
#               used as-is in the website, so use HTML.
#
#   Field 14    A comment (in HTML) what will be added as-is to the document's
#               entry on the library page.  Fortunately, I've seldom done that
#               in the past, but it needs to be done sometimes.
#
#   Field 15    If the document is a scan of a software listing, this field
#               can be used as a URL for the transcription to source file(s)
#               in the github repo.
#
#   Field 16    Similarly, this field could be a URL for the assembly listing
#               output by the "modern" assembler.
#
#   Field 17    And similarly, this field could be the URL for the
#               colorized, syntax-highlighted HTML of the assembly listing.
#
#   Field 18    In cases where we have a core dump of software without having
#               source code, this field can contain a URL to the core dump
#               (typically in our github repo).

    </a>If just seeing 
    what went into each mission isn't enough for you, and you need to see the vast 
    sweep of all the AGC and AGS software development from the beginning in 1963 
    until the end in 1971, I have a chart of that as well. Alas, there's no LVDC 
    info in the chart, and I've had to leave out some AGC non-mission branches like LA MESH,
    DIANA, and so forth. But I included some non-mission branches,
    particularly SHEPATIN and ZERLINA, since we actually have representative
    copies of those. There's a small detail 
    from the full chart to the right, and if you click that image, the full chart 
    will appear. Admittedly, there's some guesswork involved because of lacking 
    information, particularly in the very early years, but I think the chart 
    captures pretty well what's going on.  Each bubble in the chart represents
    some specific revision of some specific AGC program, or else a range of 
    revisions when there's just too much information missing to distinguish 
    between them.  Gray bubbles are Block 1 code, brown bubbles are Block 2 CM
    code, yellow bubbles are LM code, and white bubble are AGS. The name of the 
    AGC program is in red if
    core ropes were actually manufactured for that revision.  The arrows connecting
    the bubbles tell you what revisions of what programs evolved into what other
    revisions.  The arrows are also decorated with lists telling what PCRs, PCNs,
    software-anomaly reports, and ACB requests were involved in that particular
    stage of the evolution &mdash; though in many cases that's simply "TBD", as it
    actually is in the detail image at the right. The
    full chart, by the way, is about 40 times as high as it is wide, so be 
    prepared to scroll downward a <i>lot</i> if you look at very much of it.<br>
    <br>
    The table below is a list of all releases of AGC software (that we're aware of)
    for the purpose of manufacturing core-rope memory modules.  This information
    was gleaned from many, many documents in the library, as opposed to a single
    authoritative source, so there are unfortunately many gaps and question marks
    in the table.  A number of the software revisions for which we have the source
    code were never manufactured into memory modules, such as ZERLINA, SUPER JOB,
    and DAP AURORA, so they don't appear in the table at all.  Conversely, there
    are many software revisions manufactured as ropes for which we have no 
    contemporary source listing or modern reconstruction.<br><br>

    The term "math flow" refers to the underlying, implementation-independent,

    to <i>use</i> those computers after they're programmed.

    There are several ways the Apollo and Gemini guidance computers' math flow 
    are represented in our collected documentation.
    For example, there may simply be a set of mathematical equations that represent
    the physics of spacecraft motion.  At the other end of the spectrum, there 
    may be detailed sets of flowcharts that form an almost-complete pictorial 
    representation of the

    blurbPcrsPcns = """
    Program Change Requests (PCRs) were the official mechanism by which proposed
    AGC software changes were submitted to the NASA's Software 
    Control Board (SCB), for subsequent approval or rejection.  The PCR was the 
    normal tool for this, and PCRs could be created either by MIT/IL or by NASA,
    but did not take effect until action was taken by the SCB.  The lesser-used
    PCN is almost the same as a PCR, except that MIT/IL unilaterally put them into
    effect <i>as if</i> NASA's SCB had approved them ... even though the SCB 
    <i>could</i> end up disapproving the PCN and forcing MIT/IL to undo whatever
    work they had done in connection with it. Often the PCN was used for simple
    clerical changes in the GSOP, which were almost certain to eventually win SCB
    approval, but sometimes they were apparently used for issues that blocked 
    further development and thus which would cause scheduling issues if it were 
    necessary to stop work until the next SCB meeting.  In any case, the 
    signficance (for us) of either PCRs or PCNs is 
    that since AGC software changes were
    governed by them, knowledge of the PCRs/PCNs is of tremendous importance in 
    tracking changes between AGC software revisions ... or 
    alternatively, of no importance whatever if you're not interested in 
    understanding the evolution of the software.
    <br><br>
    When the full text of a PCR or PCN isn't currently available, information 
    has instead come from
    other contemporary documentation, including:
    <ul>
    <li>Lists in the GSOP documents of PCRs/PCNs incorporated into various AGC revisions.</li>
    <li>SCB meeting minutes listing PCRs/PCNs which had been approved or rejected.
    The SCB minutes often give a much fuller explanation than the mere titles of
    the PCRs/PCNs provide.</li>
    <li>LUMINARY or COLOSSUS memos describing the revision-to-revision changes in
    the software.  These also may give more information than the mere titles of the
    PCRs or PCNs.</li>
    <li>Lists of PCRs/PCNs compiled by the development managers for various missions.</li>
    </ul>
    None of these sources are meticulous about using the exact titles of the PCRs.
    <br><br>
    All known PCRs and PCNs for which we have any information at all are listed,
    whether approved or disapproved by the SCB, and whether or not a copy is currently 
    available in the library.  Unless stated otherwise, PCRs/PCNs were approved for
    implementation.  The entries below are arranged by PCR/PCN number. We've also 
    added a rough categorization to 
    each PCR/PCN entry as to which AGC program(s) it applies to:  SUNDISK, SUNDANCE,

    """

    blurbAnomalies = """
    In this section, we cover Assembly Control Board Requests and
    Software Anomaly Reports.  These acted similarly to PCRs and 
    PCNs (see above), and have a similar importance for us in 
    understanding the evolution of AGC software over time.  The difference from 
    PCRs/PCNs is that approvals or rejections were made by MIT/IL's
    Assembly Control Board (ACB) rather than by NASA's SCB.  The scopes of the 
    SCB's actions and the ACB's actions differed in that the SCB decided upon the 
    contents of (or changes to) the software specification (which
    was regarded as the GSOP document), whereas the ACB examined discrepancies 
    between the software and the specification, or else items left unspecified 
    altogether by the GSOP (and therefore presumably of little or no importance

    Software Anomaly Reports could presumably
    be acted upon much more quickly and easily than was the case for PCRs and PCNs.
    <br><br>
    ACB Requests and Software Anomaly Reports have no titles as such, so the titles 
    given below are actually extracts from the (often rather long) problem 
    descriptions given in forms.  The entries are sorted by document number.

    We have precious little LVDC documentation, and even less LVDC software.  
    The Wikipedia article on the LVDC at the time I first wrote on this subject
    lamented that all of the LVDC software has probably vanished and does not exist 
    any longer. Fortunately, that has turned out to be false, although there may
    be enough truth in it to make us very uncomfortable.
    """

    blurbIMCC = """
    This section relates to the Integrated Mission Control Center (IMCC), and
    to its facilities, particularly the Mission Control Center in 
    Houston (MCC-Houston) and the Real Time Computer Complex (RTCC).  Emphasis is
    on the physical facilities and their development and history, rather than 
    anything they accomplished in so far as specific Gemini or Apollo missions 
    are concerned.
    """

    blurbSoundAndFury = """
    The title of this section is a little misleading, in that many people, upon 
    seeing the lead-in "sound and fury ...", would immediately fill in the ending 
    "... signifying nothing". 
    <br><br>
    I certainly don't intend to imply that the items in this section "signify 
    nothing", but you may nevertheless have to put in a little more effort to 
    determine just what they do signify within the context of AGC development.  
    That's because these memos share some common characteristics that add to your 
    confusion, such as:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>They present just one side of an obviously two-sided
        discussion.</li>
      <li>They don't tend to share the emotionally-neutral tone that
        almost every other document in this library has.<br>
      </li>
      <li>We don't know the personal interrelationships between the
        people involved.</li>
      <li>They were written before the invention of emojis. 
      <img src="smiley.png" alt="" width="16" height="16"></li>
    </ul>
    And there may be individually-complicating features as well.  One of the memos, 
    for example, was written on April Fools' Day.  Is it fooling, or is it not?  I 
    can't say.  What I can say is that if you decode the memos properly, it's 
    possible that there may be lessons to be learned from them.
    """

    blurbSomethingDifferent = """
    In this section, we provide some stuff that doesn't directly pertain to any of 
    the computers in Apollo or Gemini.  But if the original developers give me 
    interesting and sometimes unique material, or if I find interesting material 
    related to them, I'd like to present it anyway. 
    """

    blurbElectroMechanical = """
    Electrical and mechanical engineering drawings of Apollo systems cannot be 
    represented well in this Document Library page, because there are hundreds of 
    thousands of them.
    <br><br>
    Large numbers of engineering drawings are presented here <i>indirectly</i>, in
    two ways.  The first way is
    in the form of "drawing trees".  For example, Apollo 11 contained 2 Guidance
    & Navigation
    systems, one for the CM (drawing 2014999-101) and one for the LM 
    (drawing 6014999-091). Each of these, in turn, represents a set of drawings, 
    with one drawing for each
    of its assemblies.  And each of those assembly drawings represents yet another 
    set of 
    drawings, one for each of its subassemblies.  And so on.  But only the
    two top-level drawings for any given mission are explicitly presented here.  
    It is those top-level drawings that serve as a portal to allow you to 
    navigate throughout the entire hierarchy of drawings. The second way engineering
    drawings are represented indirectly is in the
    guise of NARA-SW (National Archives, Ft. Worth) aperture-card boxes, each of
    which holds ~1800 microform images of drawings.  This aperture-card box 
    form is useful for seeing
    entire groups of engineering drawings that have been newly added to the 
    Document Library as new aperture-card boxes are scanned.
    <br><br>
    You also have the option of instead going to our 
    <a href="TipueSearch.html">G&N engineering-drawing search engine</a>
     which allows you to find engineering drawings by fragments of drawing numbers 
    or drawing titles.  Or you can try our <a href="ElectroMechanical.html">
    Electro-Mechanical page</a>, which may provide additional resources or 
    related information.

    in the immediately-preceding section.)  The entries are ordered by 
    publication date.

    If an item appears <i>only</i> in this section, then perhaps it should be

# The following list determines how to divide the page up into sections.
# Items are chosen for the sections based on the parameters in the table,
# and on document-specific data in the database, such as document numbers,
# targets, and keywords. The parameters targets[] and keywords[] are simply
# lists of targets and keywords that may appear in the database, and an item
# is included in the section if there is any overlap. The DocumentNumbers[]
# parameters, on the other hand, try to match only the leading portions of
# strings.  As an alternative to the above, you can include the key/value
# pair "all":True (which matches *all* records) or "none":True (which matches
# *no* record, but still creates a section with a blurb).
#
# Note that the default collating function is myDateAuthorSortKey, so if that's
# what's wanted, you can simply leave out 
#       "sortKey" : myDateAuthorSortKey
#
# The anchor field must have a matching <a name="..."></a> tag.
# Only entries with an "anchor" key are used in the table of contents.
# Never remove the 1st two entries below, but the "anchor" can be removed
# to disable either of the first 2 entries.  If restored, the anchors must
# be "Debug" and "RecentAdditions" precisely.  Note that keyword- and
# target-searches are not case sensitive; in practice, they will all be 
# converted to lower-case, regardless of how they're entered in this array.
#
# The keyword "release table" is special.  It is used only in the list below,
# and not in the database.  When present, the file releaseTable.html is fetched
# and inserted as-is below the section's blurb.  I expect this is useful only
# for the Assembly Listings section, though a similar technique might be useful
# someday in other sections.  If used, the file releaseTable.html
# should be prepared from the Google Sheets spreadsheet titled
# "Known AGC Software Releases" by using the instructions in the script
# fixReleaseTable.py.
