            The VM provides the ability to run or build <i>all</i>
            software provided by the Virtual AGC Project that's related
            to Gemini, Apollo, or the Space Shuttle, including software
            not covered by the build-instructions found later on this
            page.&nbsp; This avoids the necessity of manually performing
            tricky builds and installations, as well as the risk that
            these builds or installations will fail on your particular
            computer platform.&nbsp; However, it does not (yet?) include
            original flight software source-code for the LVDC or Space
            Shuttle that we've been holding back under fear of ITAR
            backlash. <br>
            <br>
            Since the VM is a rather substantial download, you would
            typically download it just once and then upgrade it in-place
            to newer versions of Virtual AGC as desired.&nbsp; This is a
            very-simple and convenient procedure, though time-consuming,
            and is considerably improved from the prior, now-obsoleted
            32-bit VM, and can be performed at any time.<br>
            <br>
            Updates to the VM's Linux operating system are a different
            matter, and should only be performed an as-advised basis.<br>

    </h2>
    <h3><a name="Characteristics_of_the_Virtual_AGC_VM"
        id="Characteristics_of_the_Virtual_AGC_VM"></a>Use and Updating
      of the VM<br>
    </h3>
    Virtual AGC can be used in a couple of ways, one of which
    (installing it directly on your own computer) is covered later one,
    and the other of which is running it in a so-called "virtual
    machine" (or VM for short).<br>
    <br>
    The VM approach should work with most host systems supported by the
    hypervisor known as <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>,
    including any 64-bit 'x86 version of Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris,
    or FreeBSD.&nbsp; Basically, you just install VirtualBox, download
    the Virtual AGC VM, and then run it!&nbsp; All of which side-steps
    any potential inconvenience in building Virtual AGC from source code
    on your own physical computer.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    But before talking about how to install the Virtual AGC VM, let's
    talk first about how you can use it once it's installed.&nbsp; In
    other words, let's have an advertisement for it!&nbsp; One nice
    thing about the VM approach is that the virtual machine's "display
    screen" can be made as big or small as you like, within the limits
    of the size of your physical display.&nbsp; For the sake of my
    explanations below, I'll make the VM screen smaller than I normally
    would for my own purposes â€” which would be just to expand it to fill
    an entire monitor â€”, but perhaps appropriately for our modern times
    in which people are often more prone to use tiny laptop computers
    rather than huge desktop systems.<br>
    <br>
    When the VM is run, the desktop you'll be presented with is
    something like this:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="VM64-images/InitialDesktop.jpg" alt="" height="347"
        width="461"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    (This desktop will actually be surrounded by a border with
    VirtualBox's own menu, status bar, and so on, not to mention your
    operating-system-provided title bar, but I don't want to complicate
    matters so I've omitted such extras.) <br>
    <br>
    What is all of this stuff?&nbsp; Well, it's pretty self-explanatory,
    I suspect, but here's a brief rundown starting at the upper left:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>An icon for running Virtual AGC itself via a graphical user
        interface (GUI) that we'll talk more about below.</li>
      <li>An icon that loads a web browser and takes you to our software
        repository on GitHub.</li>
      <li>An icon that downloads the latest version of the Virtual AGC
        software (including any new or updated AGC or AGS source code
        that may be in it), and rebuilds it all from source.&nbsp; All
        you have to do is click it and then sit back and wait for it to
        finish.&nbsp; I'd recommend exiting from the VirtualAGC
        application (if it happens to be running) before doing that.</li>
      <li>An icon that loads a web browser and takes you to our main
        website at Ibiblio.</li>
      <li>An icon that opens a folder of visual-debugging projects for
        various AGC software versions.&nbsp; We'll talk more about that
        below.</li>
      <li>An icon that may give you more (and possibly more-up-to-date)
        information about the VM than I'm providing here.</li>
      <li>An icon that loads a web browser and takes you to the website
        of the NASSP (Apollo) add-on for the Orbiter
        spaceflight-simulation system.&nbsp; Alas, Orbiter/NASSP is a
        Windows-only system that you cannot run within the Virtual AGC
        VM, but the website can still be useful.&nbsp; NASSP integrates
        Virtual AGC's emulations of the AGC and AGS computers into their
        simulations.&nbsp; NASSP is not, however, affiliated with the
        Virtual AGC Project in any official way.</li>
      <li>An icon that loads a web browser and takes you to our
        highest-resolution documentation images at The Internet Archive.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    If you were to run the Virtual AGC application from its icon, you'd
    see something like the following:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="VM64-images/GUI.jpg" alt="" height="474" width="631"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    You can do a number of things from this VirtualAGC GUI, such as run
    the simulation by clicking the "Run!" button at the bottom of the
    application's window.&nbsp; With the options shown above, this means
    running the AGC software originally written for Apollo 11's Lunar
    Module, which happens to be called LUMINARY 99, with a DSKY
    (display/keyboard) peripheral device, and with a telemetry
    monitor.&nbsp; The screenshot below shows that happening.&nbsp; The
    main window of the application disappears when you do that, and what
    appears in its place are the various windows for the DSKY and other
    peripheral(s), arranged in a way intended to facilitate making
    everything viewable at once.&nbsp; The extent to which this
    arranging succeeds at making everything visible depends on the
    options used and the amount of real estate available on the virtual
    desktop.&nbsp; In the example below, the arranger has slightly
    overlapped some windows, but has mostly succeeded. To exit the
    simulation, you'd just close any one of the open windows; the other
    windows would then close automatically, albeit probably with a short
    delay, and the main screen of the application would return.<br>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; Actually, if you
        close the window labeled "Simulation Status", it won't close the
        simulation at all, but rather it closes the simulation
        manager.&nbsp; That's a bug, not a feature, but one which I'm at
        a loss to fix at present.</font><br>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="VM64-images/running.jpg" alt="" height="383" width="680"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    &nbsp; Another thing you can do is view the AGC source code (in this
    case, for LUMINARY 99), by clicking the button marked "AGC" near the
    lower left of the application's window.&nbsp; I did that and clicked
    around a few times before creating the screenshot below:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="VM64-images/source.jpg" alt="" height="427" width="759"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    I promised above to talk a little bit about the desktop icon labeled
    "AGC Visual Debugging.&nbsp; If you click it, a new window will pop
    up that lists a number of the Apollo Guidance Computer software
    versions available, though by no means all (or even most) of
    them.&nbsp; These are the AGC software versions for which we've
    created visual-debugging projects.&nbsp; Hopefully, many more such
    AGC versions will be debuggable in the future, but for now these are
    the only ones provided.&nbsp; Click on one of them to begin visual
    debugging of the associated AGC software version.&nbsp;
    (Unfortunately, visual debugging for Abort Guidance System software
    is not available.)<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="VM64-images/codeblocksFolder.jpg" alt="" height="405"
        width="720"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    Visual debugging AGC software works pretty much as you'd expect, if
    you've ever done visual debugging in the past.&nbsp; But like any
    tool, the Code::Blocks integrated development environment (IDE) in
    which the debugging is performed takes some getting used to.&nbsp;
    Clicking on the LUMINARY 99 entry, the Code::Blocks window that
    appears looks something like the screenshot below.&nbsp; (Before
    making the screenshot, I've actually double-clicked on one the AGC
    source-code files in the left-hand pane, and then clicked on "Tools"
    in the main menu.)<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="VM64-images/codeblocks.jpg" alt="" height="716" width="896"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    The reason I've clicked on "Tools" in the image above is that since
    I'm illustrating how to debug LUMINARY 99 from the Apollo 11 Lunar
    Module, I'll want to start a half-size Lunar Module DSKY (why not?)
    and (also why not?) a telemetry monitor as well, both of which are
    done from the Tools menu.&nbsp; The various debugging options are
    found in the tool bar with the little red right-pointing
    arrow.&nbsp; We can start the emulation in a variety of ways.&nbsp;
    For example, we might click (twice, for some reason) the "next line"
    button that's two to the right of the red arrow; this would start
    single-stepping through the software.&nbsp; But in the screenshot
    below I've started the program free-running by clicking on the red
    arrow (twice), and then have clicked the pause button (once).&nbsp;
    You can see that pause has occurred at line 66 in the source-code
    file INTER-BANK_COMMUNICATIONS.agc.&nbsp; And from this point we can
    do things like set breakpoints, single-step through the program,
    view/edit memory locations, and so forth.&nbsp; But the details are
    really out of our scope, and you'll want to consult <a
      moz-do-not-send="true"
      href="https://www.codeblocks.org/user-manual/">Code::Blocks
      documentation online</a> for more info, I suppose.&nbsp; More
    information can also be found in our Wiki at GitHub, <a

    <br>
    <h3><a name="Customization"></a>Customization of the VM</h3>
    Beyond Virtual AGC itself, you might like to personalize the VM'd
    desktop for your own convenience and taste.&nbsp; For example, <i>I</i>
    personally think that single-clicking desktop items to activate them
    is better than double-clicking them.&nbsp; <i>You</i> might want to
    change that.&nbsp; (To see instructions on how to do that,
    single-click on the Info desktop icon.)&nbsp; Other examples that
    occur to me are adjusting the language, the display size, the time
    zone, and so forth, but of course you can make any changes you
    like.&nbsp; The VM runs a variety of Ubuntu Linux called Lubuntu,
    and you can google how to work with that, or you can use the Info
    icon on the VM's desktop to also get a variety of helpful
    customization hints.&nbsp; I'll just confine myself here to pointing
    out that the Lubuntu menu is called up from the little blue icon at
    the lower left of the desktop, and that the Lubuntu configuration
    settings can be gotten to from that Lubuntu menu by using
    Preferences/LXQt-Settings/LXQt-Configuration-Center as shown in the
    screenshot:<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="VM64-images/options.jpg" alt="" height="417" width="511"><br>
    </div>
    <br>
    Notice, by the way, that unlike all of the other screenshots so far,
    the one above includes VirtualBox menu at the top and a VirtualBox
    status bar at the bottom.&nbsp; I've included those because I want
    to explain that using the Lubuntu configuration center to change the
    monitor settings may not give you complete control over the display
    resolution: In addition, you may need to make adjustments in the <i>VirtualBox</i>
    menu's View/Virtual-Screen-1 settings as in the screenshot below; of
    course, I'm not saying you'll use those <i>specific</i> settings,
    but just that adjustment both of Lubuntu and of VirtualBox may be
    needed.&nbsp; If you have a 4K monitor, setting "Scale to 150%" or
    "Scale to 200%" might be useful in making the items on the VM'd
    desktop large enough to be easily legible.<br>

    <h3><a name="Installation_of_the_Virtual_AGC_VM_"
        id="Installation_of_the_Virtual_AGC_VM_"></a>Installation of the
      VM<br>
    </h3>
    The basic steps are these:<br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>If VirtualBox is not already installed, <a
          href="https://www.virtualbox.org">download and install
          VirtualBox</a>, using whatever version is suitable for your
        computer system.&nbsp; The Virtual AGC virtual machine (VM) you
        will download was created with <a
          href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_3">VirtualBox






































          7.1.4</a>, but I hope it will work with other versions as
        well.&nbsp; Be sure to install not only VirtualBox as such, but
        also its so-called "Extension Pack".</li>
      <li>If your version of VirtualBox differs from the one in which
        the VM was created, when you run the VM you may be prompted to
        reinstall VirtualBox's "guest additions".&nbsp; Do so.&nbsp; If
        you do, note that the username and password of the VM are both
        "virtualagc".<br>
      </li>
      <li>The VM is compressed in 7z format for downloading, so if your
        operating system doesn't already have software support for 7z
        archives, you need to install extra software that provides
        it.&nbsp; In Linux, you're probably okay without doing anything,
        or at worst just using your distribution's software
        repository.&nbsp; For other platforms, a little googling reveals
        that the program <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>
        provides these formats for Windows, and there are "unofficial"
        installers for 7zip for Mac, Solaris, and FreeBSD.&nbsp;
        However, various other programs work as well, I think, such as <a
          href="http://www.winzip.com/win/en/index.htm">WinZip</a>.</li>
      <li>Download <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="Downloads/VirtualAGC-VM64.7z">the current compressed
          Virtual AGC VM</a>.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Extract the contents, resulting in a folder called
        "VirtualAGC-VM64".&nbsp; The 7z file is no longer used after
        extraction and may be deleted ... though obviously <i>we'd</i>
        prefer you retained it for a while to make sure you don't need
        to download it again if some mishap occurs.&nbsp; VirtualBox
        tends to store all of its virtual machines in the same folder
        (on Linux, for example, that folder is "~/VirtualBox
        VMs").&nbsp; It's not necessary to conform to this practice,
        though can do so for consistency if you like.</li>
      <li>Run VirtualBox, and from its main menu select
        Machine/Add.&nbsp; In the dialog you're presented with, find the
        folder just now created for the Virtual AGC VM, and select the
        file VirtualAGC-VM64.vbox.</li>
      <li>The Virtual AGC VM will be visible in VirtualBox's manager
        program, and you can run it from there.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    It's hard to pin down exactly what physical computer resources
    you'll need to run the VM.&nbsp; As downloaded, the VM is set to use
    4GB of RAM and 4 CPUs, but those settings are adjustable easily by
    you within the VirtualBox project settings.&nbsp; I've just now
    tried it with 1GB and 1 CPU on my 10+ year old computer, and there
    was nothing obviously wrong with how it ran; your experience may
    vary.&nbsp; <br>
    <p>Perhaps of more concern to you, I've endowed the VM with a
      virtual disk that's nominally 40GB.&nbsp; The way VirtualBox
      virtual disks work, they are actually usually smaller than the
      nominal size, but physically expand as they fill up.&nbsp; So as
      delivered, the virtual disk appears to you to be only about 14GB,
      but you may later find it using 40GB of your disk!&nbsp; I made it
      this large because with the previous generation VM, now
      superseded, I had trimmed the virtual disk to a bare minimum and
      found it impossible to grow it when I realized it had filled
      up.&nbsp; You may think that 40GB is excessive and prefer to shave
      off a few (or a lot) of gigabytes.&nbsp; The procedure to do so is
      trickier than I'd like, so I won't explain it unless somebody
      actually asks me about it; or you can google it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, technically, for any Linux pros, the VM does not have a
      swap partition.&nbsp; You can adjust the VM itself to give
      yourself one, but if you're pro enough to desire this, you're too
      much of a pro for me to instruct you on the details of how to do
      it.&nbsp; <br>

    <h3><a name="OtherVirt"></a>Using Alternate Hypervisors In Place of
      VirtualBox<br>
    </h3>

        (Windows/Linux/Mac, commercial, but with a restricted-feature
        free version).</li>

        (Mac only, commercial).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Virtual AGC VM is only provided in a form specific to
      VirtualBox.&nbsp; The VirtualBox native virtual-disk format (VDI)
      that we provide in the VirtualAGC VM can be converted to any of
      the following virtual-disk formats native to other hypervisors:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>VMDK (for VMware)</li>
      <li>HDD (for Parallels)</li>
      <li>QCOW (for QEMU)</li>
      <li>VHD (for Hyper-V)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As for <i>how</i> to perform such a conversion, either
      VirtualBox or QEMU can convert VDI-format disks to any of the
      formats listed above.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Details:</b>&nbsp; At least in v7.1
        of VirtualBox, conversion of a VDI file can be performed from
        the VirtualBox Manager application, from it's main menu:&nbsp;
        Select File/Tools/Virtual-Media-Manager.&nbsp; Then right-click
        on any VDI file, choose the Copy operation, and select the
        desired format to create.&nbsp; Alternately, conversion can be
        performed from a command line with a command of the form
        "vboxmanage clonemedium ...".<br>
        <br>
        QEMU is more convenient in some ways, since to perform a
        conversion you don't even need a full installation of QEMU, but
        merely the <b>qemu-img</b> command-line program, which at least
        in Linux Mint is a separate installation ("apt install
        qemu-utils").&nbsp; The command to convert to VMDK, for example,
        is "qemu-img -f VDI -F VMDK VirtualAGC-VM64.vdi
        VirtualAGC-VM64.vmdk".&nbsp; I've not actually tried it myself,
        though.<b>&nbsp; </b>It's good that a full QEMU installation
        isn't needed for conversion, since the technique for performing
        a full install of QEMU can be a tad unobvious.&nbsp; At least in
        Linux Mint, the technique is to use "sudo apt intall
        bridge-utils virt-manager" and then reboot; QEMU itself can then
        be run as the "Virtual Machine Manager".&nbsp; Who would have
        guessed?<br>
      </font></blockquote>
    <p>Additionally, for hypervisors <i>other</i> than VirtualBox,
      you'll have to manually create a VM using the native tools
      provided by the particular hypervisor, and then attach the
      VirtualAGC virtual disk to that VM.&nbsp; In my experience,
      creating a VM that uses a pre-existing virtual disk may prove to
      be a tricky feat in some hypervisors â€” which like to create the
      virtual disk <i>for</i> you at the time the VM itself is created,
      instead of admitting you might already have one â€”, but I have
      faith in you!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Of course, just being able to create a VM with a virtual disk in
      the appropriate format for a given hypervisor does not necessarily
      imply the ability of that hypervisor to run that virtual
      machine!&nbsp; One would hope so, but believe me, it ain't
      necessarily so.&nbsp; (I've made some conversions that <i>won't</i>
      boot up afterward.)&nbsp; But in the case of the VirtualAGC VM, it
      does seem okay.&nbsp; Here's some testing I performed:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>VMware Workstation Pro:&nbsp; I used VirtualBox to create a
        VMware virtual disk, and using that converted disk ran the
        Virtual AGC VM in VMware Workstation Pro.&nbsp; Once the VM was
        booted up, then from a command line within it, I installed
        "VMware Tools" in order to get better control over the virtual
        screen, using the command "sudo apt install
        open-vm-tools".&nbsp; (Recall that the VM's password is
        "virtualagc".)&nbsp;&nbsp; The VM seemed to work fine.</li>
      <li>QEMU:&nbsp; QEMU is actually able to use the VDI file
        directly, without conversion, so I didn't attempt to convert
        it.&nbsp; The VM seemed to work fine.&nbsp; <b>But!&nbsp;</b> I
        wasn't able to use that VDI file in Virtualbox after running it
        in QEMU.&nbsp; So it might be a good idea to convert the Virtual
        AGC VM's virtual-disk file into a QEMU native format, or at
        least clone it into a separate VDI file, before using it with
        QEMU.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In all of the cases I was able to try, some of the features I
      like that are provided by VirtualBox were absent, though nothing
      that would seriously prevent running the Virtual AGC VM in one of
      these alternate virtualization systems. <br>

    <h3><a name="Limitation" id="Limitation"></a>Limitation</h3>
    <p>Building Virtual AGC from source actually has a limitation
      compared to running the VM as described above, which is that while
      the VM is already set up for visual debugging of AGC code using
      Code::Blocks, this capability is not a part of Virtual AGC
      proper.&nbsp; That is, Code::Blocks based AGC debugging has its
      own set of installations, requirements, and setups, distinct from
      those of building Virtual AGC proper ... which is all that's
      discussed below.&nbsp; If (once Virtual AGC is built and working
      satisfactorily) you want to do visual debugging, you need to
      install Code::Blocks and should consult <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/wiki/DevelopmentWithCodeBlocks">the






































        instructions for development using Code::Blocks on our GitHub
        wiki</a>, as well as <a
        href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/wiki/VisualDebugging">the
instructions






































        for visual debugging</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Of course, it also has the limitation that we can't actually deal
      with every platform people might <i>try</i> to use.&nbsp; So I
      make a pretty strong effort to make sure it works on Ubuntu- and
      Debian-based 64-bit 'x86 Linux, which I use every day, and
      occasionally (rarely) try to check that the process still works on
      whatever versions of Raspberry Pi, Windows, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, and
      Solaris it happens to be convenient for me to run personally.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="Getting_the_Source_Code_" id="Getting_the_Source_Code_"></a>Getting

    </h3>
    <p>The complete up-to-the-moment source code is available from <a
        href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc">GitHub</a>.&nbsp;
There






































      are several ways which one might choose to download it, such as <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/archive/master.zip">in a
        zipfile</a> or using the 'git' program, which in Linux (for
      example) would look like this:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc<br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    The "git clone" method has the great advantage that the download can
    be updated later with a simply command ("git pull"), whereas the
    zipfile methods basically requires starting over again from
    scratch.&nbsp; In either case, you end up with a folder called
    virtualagc.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    What you do with it after that depends on which platform you intend
    to run Virtual AGC on, and that's the topic of the next few
    sections.&nbsp; It's also possible though increasingly unlikely that
    <a
href="https://github.com/rburkey2005/virtualagc/blob/master/README.md#linux-1">the






































      instructions at the GitHub repository</a> may (or may not) be more
    up-to-date than those here.<br>
    <h3><a name="4K"></a>High-Resolution Displays Such as 4K</h3>
    <p>The advent of high-resolution displays such 4K, in which the
      number of pixels per inch has increased drastically but the
      physical dimensions of the display have barely changed, has a
      dramatic effect on graphical programs such as our <b>yaDSKY2</b>,
      <b>yaDEDA2</b>, <b>VirtualAGC</b>, and so on, whose
      user-interfaces were developed with pixel-based positioning in
      mind rather than distance-based positioning.&nbsp; In other words,
      if you run (say) <b>yaDSKY2</b>, designed for a 1920Ã—1080
      display, on a 3840Ã—2160 display that's roughly the same size
      physical dimensions, it's going to look very tiny.&nbsp; Possibly
      it will be unreadable.&nbsp; Alas, this effect cannot always be
      detected in an automated way by the software itself.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In Windows and Linux you can work around this in Virtual AGC by
      defining an environment variable called <code>AGC_SCALE</code>
      which controls the "scaling" of the graphical user interfaces in
      Virtual AGC programs.&nbsp; In Mac OS there is a subtle
      difference, in that this environment variable must be set before <i>building</i>
      Virtual AGC, whereas in Windows and Linux it merely needs to be
      set prior to <i>running</i> Virtual AGC.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 4K vs
      1080p example just given, you might use<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>AGC_SCALE=2.0<br></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If the <code>AGC_SCALE</code> variable isn't defined at all, the
      scaling defaults to 1.0, so you needn't bother with it unless the
      Virtual AGC programs don't look right.&nbsp; And it doesn't matter
      exactly what the scale factor is, as long as it's something
      comfortable to you.&nbsp; In the example above, it didn't need to
      be 2.0; perhaps you found 1.5 to be good enough, or 2.25 to be
      better.&nbsp; However, not all Virtual AGC programs treat scaling
      with equal grace, so 2.0 is ultimately likely to prove to be the
      best choice anyway.&nbsp; Note too that the scaling is going to be
      more "exact" if it's an exact integer.&nbsp; For fractional values
      like 2.25, various controls in the user interface might be
      positioned incorrectly by fractions of a pixel.&nbsp; And if large
      scaling factors are used, imperfections in the graphics designed
      into the user interface will become exaggerated, causing them to
      appear blocky.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The method for making such environment variables permanently
      available to all Virtual AGC programs â€” i.e., <i>both</i> to
      programs run from desktop icons <i>and</i> to those run from a
      command line â€” varies by operating-system type:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Linux:&nbsp; Use a text editor (as an administrator) to edit
        the file /etc/profile, and add the line "export AGC_SCALE=<i>X.X</i>"
        to it, where <i>X.X</i> is whatever scale factor you
        choose.&nbsp; Note that this won't have any effect until after
        the next reboot.</li>
      <li>Windows:&nbsp; From the Windows menu, open the <i>Control
          Panel</i>, then choose <i>System and Security</i>, then <i>System</i>,
        then (in the right-hand pane) <i>Advanced System Settings</i>,
        then <i>Environment Variables</i>.&nbsp; Create a new <i>User
          Variable</i> called AGC_SCALE, and assign it whatever scale
        factor <i>X.X</i> you like.&nbsp; This won't take effect until
        you close the <i>Environment Variables</i> window by hitting
        OK, and will only affect new command lines or Virtual AGC
        programs.</li>
      <li>Mac OS:&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no <i>good</i> solution that I
        can ascertain.&nbsp; You might be best advised to google this
        yourself, for your own specific Mac OS version.&nbsp; But here's
        a not-very-satisfactory answer that will probably work for
        you:&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Before</i> <a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="#Sequoia">building Virtual AGC</a>, close the Terminal
        application if it's running, then use a text editor to edit the
        files ~/.zprofile and ~/.bashrc, and add the line "export
        AGC_SCALE=<i>X.X</i>" to both of them, where <i>X.X</i> is
        whatever scale factor you choose.&nbsp; Only then should you
        build Virtual AGC.&nbsp; In <i>rebuilding</i> Virtual AGC after
        a change to AGC_SCALE, be sure to use the "clean" build-target.
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="wxWidgets"></a>Regarding wxWidgets</h3>
    <p><b>wxWidgets</b> is a cross-platform toolkit, suitable for
      writing software have a graphical user interface (GUI) that can be
      used with a simple recompilation on any platform supported by <b>wxWidgets</b>.&nbsp;





      In other words, using a single base of source code, Virtual AGC
      can be recompiled to run on Windows or Mac OS or Linux or
      wherever.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>In building Virtual AGC from source, version 2.8 of <b>wxWidgets</b>
      has been recommended for a long time, and the instructions given
      below often rely on this fact.&nbsp; However, I have observed that
      it is becoming increasingly difficult to even put together a setup
      having a working version of <b>wxWidgets</b> 2.8 in Linux,
      because its prerequisites often conflict seemingly irreconcilably
      with components of default installations of Linux.&nbsp; Indeed,
      it's not even clear to me if the current Virtual AGC code base
      compiles with <b>wxWidgets</b> 2.8, or it it works once compiled,
      because I seem to have to working installation upon which to test
      it.&nbsp; Moreover, I have no working installations of 2.8 on Mac
      OS or Windows to work with.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Virtual AGC is thus currently being developed using <b>wxWidgets</b>
      version 3.2.&nbsp; Given a choice between <b>wxWidgets</b> 2.8,
      3.0, or 3.2, choose 3.2.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a name="CMake-Based_Builds"></a>CMake-Based Builds</h3>
    <p>Because I am lazy, I prefer to develop software only with the
      tools I already know and understand.&nbsp; Usually, roughly
      speaking, those end up being the minimalist tools that there's a
      fighting chance the majority of developers can also work with
      somewhat easily.&nbsp; For better or worse, that's why all of the
      "official" build instructions for Virtual AGC on various target
      platforms in the following sections are based simply on 'make'
      (specifically, GNU 'make'), without the fancier kind of build
      environments that may be easier for the user but have a steeper
      learning curve for the developer.&nbsp; For example, among the
      "fancy" build environments I'm referring to are those based on
      autoconf/automake or CMake, which many would prefer.&nbsp; I
      myself might prefer them ... as a user rather than a maintainer!<br>
    </p>
    <p>However, not everyone is as lazy as I or philosophically inclined
      in quite the same way, so sometimes others step up to fill in the
      gaps I've left.&nbsp; This is the case with CMake-based builds of
      Virtual AGC.&nbsp; Michael Hirsch has stepped up to do so (thanks,
      Michael!), and if the "official" instructions below don't appeal
      to you, or if you simply like the idea of using CMake, Michael's <a
href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/wiki/Building-Virtual-AGC-Using-CMake">documentation






















        for the CMake-based build process can be found in our GitHub
        repository's wiki</a>.&nbsp; Whether those instructions are
      up-to-date or not is a question I'd prefer not to address.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Since Michael maintains both that wiki page and the CMake process
      itself, please don't attempt to get any sensible response from me
      (RSB) if you encounter problems with them or have questions.&nbsp;
      You'll want to use our GitHub repository's issue system to report
      problems, or direct inquiries via the GitHub communication system
      to Michael's tag (@scivision).<br>

    I personally develop on Linux Mint, which is Ubuntu based, and these
    instructions are targeted for those platforms.&nbsp; Presumably
    builds can be performed on other Linux platforms, but the detailed
    instructions will differ.<br>
    <h4>One-Time Setup</h4>
    <h4> </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Install the following packages, using either command-line
        commands like "sudo apt-get install <i>PackageName</i>" or else
        using whatever graphical package manager is provide.&nbsp; (On
        Linux Mint, that would be Synaptic.)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>libsdl1.2-dev</li>
        <li>libncurses5-dev</li>
        <li>liballegro4-dev</li>
        <li>g++</li>
        <li>libgtk2.0-dev</li>
        <li>tcl</li>
        <li>tk</li>
      </ul>
      <li>If wxWidgets 3.2 is available in the package repository (with
        a package name something like libwxgtk3.2-gtk3-dev), install it
        in the same manner described above.&nbsp; Otherwise, <a
          moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/">download its
          source code directly from the web</a>, and build/install it
        from source according to the instructions found there.</li>
      <li>Install both Python 3 and Python 2 if not already installed.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Building Virtual AGC Once the One-Time Setup Is Complete</h4>
    <h4> </h4>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    In the Virtual AGC source directory, run <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>make install</tt><br>
    <br>
    or<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>make clean install</tt><br>
    <br>
    This does not require a '<tt>sudo</tt>', and you <i>shouldn't</i>
    use one.
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>By the way, it's preferable to build Virtual AGC on a <i>clean</i>
      Linux installation.&nbsp; If (like me) you have a system that's
      used extensively for software development, you may have lots of
      stuff installed beyond what's mentioned above.&nbsp; That <i>extra</i>
      stuff may cause you problems.&nbsp; Hopefully that won't happen to
      most people, but I suspect that a higher percentage of folks
      interested in Virtual AGC would have this kind of problem than
      those picked at random from the general population.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p>Sometimes, extra command-line switches for 'make' can be used to
      eliminate conflicts by overriding the default compiler
      choices.&nbsp; There are two such switches, FORCE_cc and FORCE_CC,
      which respectively override the C compiler and the C++
      compiler.&nbsp; See the comments in <a
        href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc/blob/master/Makefile">the
































        Makefile</a> itself for more explanation.&nbsp; The switches can
      override not merely the filesystem paths for locating the compiler
      (when you have multiple versions of gcc or g++ installed), but can
      be used to specify completely different C/C++ compilers, such as
      clang (which might be installed using a command such as "<tt>sudo
        apt-get install clang-3.9 libclang-3.9-dev</tt>").&nbsp; As an
      example, the command I use to build Virtual AGC using clang rather
      than gcc/g++ is:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="left"><tt>make FORCE_clang=yes
          FORCE_cc=/usr/bin/clang-3.9 FORCE_CC=/usr/bin/clang++-3.9
          clean install</tt><br>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    The switch <tt>FORCE_clang</tt> in this case provides some
    additional clang tweaks beyond just the compiler locations.&nbsp;
    (Don't interpret this as a claim that clang is supported.&nbsp; It's
    not!&nbsp; But you may be able to get away with using it, if you're
    adventurous.)<br>
    <h4>Running VirtualAGC Once It Has Been Built</h4>
    On supported Linux variants, the build process creates a desktop
    icon from which you can run Virtual AGC.&nbsp; In some versions of
    Linux, you will need to right-click the icon and indicate that it is
    "trusted" before it will work properly. You can "uninstall" by
    removing the icon, the ~/VirtualAGC folder (which is the
    installation directory), and the source-code directory you
    downloaded from GitHub.<br>
    <br>
    On unsupported Linux variants, there may be no desktop icon or it
    may not work, and you may need to run the program from a command
    line, as follows:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>cd ~/VirtualAGC/Resources<br>
        ../bin/VirtualAGC<br>
      </tt></blockquote>

    The instructions here relate to building Virtual AGC using <a
      href="http://pcbsd.org/download/">PC-BSD 10.3, desktop version</a>.&nbsp;
That






































    isn't the latest version of FreeBSD (version 11), but it's much
    easier to install than FreeBSD proper, and should be 100% equivalent
    for the same version numbers.&nbsp; At any rate, I know nothing
    about FreeBSD, so my instructions may not be the most-efficient
    ones.&nbsp; The executive summary is that the build process works,
    and VirtualAGC acts normally once built.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Setup:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Install 'cmake' and GNU 'make' (gmake) using the "package"
        system, with the command "sudo pkg install cmake gmake".</li>
      <li>Install the "ports" system, if you haven't already.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Install wxWidgets 2.8.12, or as close to that 2.8.x version as
        you can get, using the "ports" system:&nbsp; "cd
        /usr/ports/x11-toolkits/wxgtk28" and "sudo make install".</li>
      <li>For whatever reason, the 'wx-config' program is installed with
        a different name.&nbsp; Make a symbolic link with the proper
        name for it somewhere in your path:&nbsp; "mkdir $HOME/bin" and
        "ln -s /usr/local/bin/wxgtk2u-2.8-config
        $HOME/bin/wx-config".&nbsp; If you test this with the command
        "wx-config --list", you should see that the default wxWidgets
        configuration is "gtk2-unicode-release-2.8".<br>
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://liballeg.org/old.html">Download Allegro 4.4.2</a>,
        or as close to that 4.4.x version as you can get.&nbsp; Prior to
        building Allegro, I had to do this: "sudo ln -s
        /usr/local/lib/libasound* /usr/lib"; I'm sure there's a much
        cleaner way to handle that problem (namely, that Allegro
        couldn't find libasound), but I don't know what it is.&nbsp; To
        build and install, do this:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>"cd allegro-4.4.2"</li>
        <li>"mkdir Build"</li>
        <li>"cd Build"</li>
        <li>"cmake .."</li>
        <li>"make"</li>
        <li>"sudo make install"</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Building Virtual AGC:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the Virtual AGC source directory, run "gmake FREEBSD=yes
        install" or "gmake FREEBSD=yes clean install".&nbsp; (Note that
        'sudo' is neither necessary nor desirable.)&nbsp; Note the use
        of 'gmake' rather than just 'make'<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    This process creates a desktop icon from which you can run Virtual
    AGC.&nbsp; You can "uninstall" by removing the icon, the
    ~/VirtualAGC folder, and the source-code directory you downloaded
    from GitHub.<br>

    The instructions here relate to building Virtual AGC using Solaris
    11.3.&nbsp; Note that my personal knowledge of Solaris is mid-way
    between "completely ignorant" and "dangerously misinformed", so you
    have to take what I say with a grain of salt.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
    the executive summary is that the instructions do work.<br>
    <br>
    One-time setup:<br>
    <ol>
      <li><a
href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/developerstudio/downloads/index.html">Install






































          Oracle Developer Studio tools</a>.&nbsp; I used version 12.5,
        and only installed the tools rather than the complete IDE.&nbsp;
        This is to give you the C and C++ compilers ('cc' and 'CC'),
        which have command-line options required by wxWidgets but not
        supported by 'gcc'.</li>
      <li>Install the <a href="https://www.opencsw.org/">Open CSW
          system</a>, add /opt/csw/bin to your PATH, and /opt/csw/lib to
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH.</li>
      <li>Install wxWidgets via the Open CSW system.</li>
      <li>Install gtk2, tcl-8, tk-8, ncurses, freeglut, cmake, and
        gnu-grep using the Package Manager.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Build Virtual AGC:<br>
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>In the Virtual AGC source directory (which for me was
        ~/git/virtualagc), run "gmake SOLARIS=yes install" or "gmake
        SOLARIS=yes clean install".&nbsp; (Note that 'sudo' is neither
        necessary nor desirable.)&nbsp; Note the use of 'gmake' (rather
        than just 'make').<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    This creates a Virtual AGC launcher (which is actually just a shell
    script) on the Desktop, and you can run Virtual AGC from that.&nbsp;
    If it asks you whether to "Run" or "Run in terminal", the proper
    choice is "Run".&nbsp; Unfortunately, no icon gets associated with
    the launcher, but you can optionally associate one by right-clicking
    on the launcher, selecting Properties, and using
    ~/VirtualAGC/Resources/ApolloPatch2-transparent.png as the image.<br>
    <br>
    You can "uninstall" by the deleting the desktop launcher, the&nbsp;
    ~/VirtualAGC folder, and the source-code directory you downloaded
    from GitHub.<br>

    There are aspects of Virtual AGC that I simply can't personally
    check on Mac OS X, because Apple no longer supports my particular
    Mac with newer versions of Mac OS X.&nbsp; I'm stuck at Mac OS X
    Lion (10.7), and with whatever version of Xcode is compatible with
    that.&nbsp; The Apple Way out of this situation is, of course,
    simply to buy a new Mac which can run a newer Mac OS.&nbsp; But the
    Tao of Apple is not the Tao of Ron.<br>
    <br>
    One particular drawback of this situation is that Xcode is now
    apparently based on the clang compiler, rather than on the gcc
    compiler that Virtual AGC was designed for.&nbsp; Now that I've
    found this out, of course, Virtual AGC has been adapted for use with
    clang, and seems to work well with clang on the Linux platforms I
    use for development purposes.&nbsp; But I can't personally test it
    for you on the Mac, since the Xcode on <i>my</i> older Mac uses
    gcc.<br>
    <br>
    Now that I've warned you, the subsections below cover what I know
    and what I theorize about building Virtual AGC on Macs.<br>
    <h4><a name="Older_Macs:_Xcode_with_gcc"></a>Older Macs<br>
    </h4>
    The executive summary is that this works (on <i>my</i> Mac, with
    Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5 and Xcode 4.6.3) and the simulated AGC, DSKY,
    etc., can be run.&nbsp; The only problem is that the pretty,
    syntax-highlighted AGC source code may not be browsable from <i>within</i>
    VirtualAGC.<br>
    <br>
    Setup:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Install <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/more">most-current
version






































          of Xcode for your version of Mac OS X</a> ... of course!&nbsp;
        I use Xcode 4.6.3.<br>
      </li>
      <li><a href="https://www.macports.org/">Install MacPorts</a>.</li>
      <li>Use MacPorts to install wxWidgets 2.8.12:&nbsp; "sudo port
        install wxgtk-2.8" or "sudo port install wxWidgets-2.8",
        depending on your Xcode version.</li>
      <li>Use MacPorts to install cmake:&nbsp; "sudo port install
        cmake".<br>
      </li>
      <li>Install Allegro 4.4.2:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Use MacPorts:&nbsp; "sudo port install allegro".&nbsp; That
          doesn't work on some versions of Xcode, in which case instead
          use the next step.&nbsp; Be aware that Allegro version 5.x
          does not work for our purposes, so alternate installations
          like "sudo port install allegro5" aren't helpful.<br>
        </li>
        <li>Install from source:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://liballeg.org/old.html">Download</a> and
            unpack the source code for version 4.4.2.</li>
          <li>"cd allegro-4.4.2"</li>
          <li>"mkdir Build"</li>
          <li>"cd Build"</li>
          <li>"cmake .."</li>
          <li>"make"</li>
          <li>"sudo make install"</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If <i>both</i> of the approaches to installing Allegro
          fail, as they did on my Mac, it's not a disaster, and you can
          still proceed.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Building Virtual AGC:<br>
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>'cd' into Virtual AGC source directory, as obtained from
        GitHub.</li>
      <li>Determine where wxWidgets was installed by using the command
        "port contents wxgtk-2.8 | grep /bin/" (or "port contents
        wxWidgets-2.8 | grep /bin/").&nbsp; What you're actually trying
        to find out is the directory in which the program 'wx-config' is
        installed.&nbsp; In my case, I found that the location was
        /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/wxWidgets.framework/Versions/wxGTK/2.8/bin.&nbsp;
You






































        have to add that to your PATH, so that the 'wx-config' program
        can be found during the build.&nbsp; The command is "export
        PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/.../bin".&nbsp; You can test that it
        worked with a command like "wx-config --list", from which we
        would like to see that the default configuration is
        "gtk2-unicode-release-2.8".&nbsp; By the way, unless you make
        this change to the PATH permanent (which is done in ~/.profile),
        the PATH will be reset back to the default one as soon as you
        close the command-line terminal you're using for this.</li>
      <li>Do "make MACOSX=yes install" or "make MACOSX=yes clean
        install".</li>
    </ol>
    The result is that a new app icon appears on the desktop, and you
    can launch VirtualAGC from that.
    <p>However, not all features of the VirtualAGC GUI program
      necessarily work.&nbsp; For example, while you can run simulated
      AGCs (which is the main thing!), you may not be able to browse the
      AGC source code from within VirtualAGC.&nbsp; What is <i>supposed</i>
      to happen when you use VirtualAGC's source-browsing feature is
      that it simply launches whatever default web-browser you have set
      up on your system, and shows you the AGC/AEA source code within
      that browser ... and indeed, this approach <i>used to work</i> in
      Mac OS X.&nbsp; But what happens for me is that there's simply an
      error message complaining that "There is no default application
      configured for HTML files".&nbsp; However, I can certainly
      configure the default browser, and have changed it back and forth
      between Safari and Chrome, so I'm not sure what this message is
      complaining about.&nbsp; Perhaps it's an X11 error.&nbsp; At any
      rate, I have not been able to solve it.&nbsp; You can still browse
      the source, of course:&nbsp; simply right-click on the VirtualAGC
      app icon on the desktop, and select "show package contents";
      navigate down to Contents/Resources/source/, select the mission
      you're interested in, and double-click on the MAIN.agc.html file
      you find in that directory.&nbsp; It will open up in your default
      browser, just as it <i>should</i> have done in the VirtualAGC
      program.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Another quirk that may be of interest on the Mac is how to run
      individual GUI applications like yaDSKY2 or yaTelemetry, without
      having to run the VirtualAGC application.&nbsp; Again, right-click
      on the VirtualAGC desktop icon and select "show package
      contents".&nbsp; Navigate down to Contents/MacOS/, and you'll find
      the various individual GUI applications there, where you can
      simply run them by double-clicking on them.<br>

    <p><i>(The instructions in </i><i><a moz-do-not-send="true"
          href="#Sequoia">the next section</a></i><i> are recommended

        there are drawbacks to doing so, because the side effects can be
        hard to undo later.&nbsp; You have been warned!&nbsp; These
        instructions do seem to work if you don't mind inviting later
        difficulties.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you happen to be using
        Macports already anyway then you may as well proceed!)</i><br>
    </p>
    <p>Ludo Visser has sent me instructions for building Virtual AGC on
      a clean installation of MacOS 12.0.1 (Monterey).&nbsp; Virtual AGC
      itself required no changes.&nbsp; He does mention that he didn't
      try it out with a joystick, but other than that indicates that
      Virtual AGC does work "out of the box" after he builds it.
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    <p> <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#4K">Recall the comments
        already made about high-resolution displays.</a>&nbsp; If your
      Mac has such a display and you will use the environment variable <code>AGC_SCALE</code>
      to correct for it, make sure that <code>AGC_SCALE</code> is
      properly set (and exported) before proceeding.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Here are Ludo's instructions, verbatim:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Install Xcode command line tools</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>          xcode-select --install
</pre>
    <ol start="2">
      <li><a href="https://www.macports.org/install.php">Install
          Macports per the instructions</a>.</li>
      <li>In a shell session:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>          sudo port selfupdate<br>	  sudo port install git +credential_osxkeychain
          sudo port install wxWidgets-3.2
          port contents wxWidgets-3.2&nbsp; | grep bin&nbsp; # note path
          export PATH=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/wxWidgets.framework/Versions/wxWidgets/3.1/bin:$PATH # path from command above
          export cc=clang
          export CC=clang++
          git clone https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc.git
          cd virtualagc
          make MACOSX=yes FORCE_clang=yes clean install<br></pre>
    The various <code>export</code> commands listed above make changes
    to the associated environment variables that are only
    temporary.&nbsp; The associated environment variables will thus
    disappear after the command-line shell is closed.&nbsp; In other
    words, you'll have to use these very same commands every time you
    open a command-line window to rebuild Virtual AGC.&nbsp; So you may
    want to make the changes permanent instead.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the
    method for making permanent changes to environment variables varies
    by Mac OS version, as well as according to which command-shell
    program is being used.&nbsp; If the <code>zsh</code> command shell
    is being used, as is the case by default in Monterey, then the <code>export</code>
    commands can be added to a file called ~/.zprofile to make them
    permanent.&nbsp; If that doesn't work for you, I'm afraid you'll
    have to research it yourself.<br>
    <br>
    Note that while any Python scripts used above are in Python 3, which
    is now installed by default (as far as I know) in Mac OS, some
    Python 2 scripts are also present in Virtual AGC even though not
    used in the installation process.&nbsp; Python 2 is no longer
    installed by default, so in the relatively-rare case in which you
    want to use one of those scripts you will need to explicitly install
    Python 2.&nbsp; As of this writing, <a
      href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/">the
      MacOS installer for the so-called "final" release of Python 2,
      namely Python 2.7.18, can be found at python.org</a>.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    I'd also note that a full installation of Xcode is not necessary for
    this build to succeed.&nbsp; It's merely necessary to have the Xcode
    "command-line tools", which is a much smaller package than the full
    Xcode.&nbsp; Admittedly, that's probably not a point that's of much
    concern to Apple aficionados.<br>
    <blockquote><b><font size="-1">Note:</font></b><font size="-1">&nbsp;







        The first time you run <b>VirtualAGC</b> from its desktop icon
        after installation, it may take a considerable amount of time to
        start up.&nbsp; There will be no such delays on subsequent
        startups.<br>
        <br>
        Moreover, the first time you run it you may see a pop-up window
        prompting you to grant it permission to modify files on your
        desktop, which you should accept.&nbsp; The desktop files it
        modifies are within the <b>VirtualAGC</b> app folder itself,
        which just happens to reside on your desktop.&nbsp; In other
        words, nothing outside of <b>VirtualAGC</b> itself is
        modified.&nbsp; However, if you are security-conscious enough
        that permitting this access seems scary, you can avoid the
        problem by moving the <b>VirtualAGC</b> app to some other
        folder not on the desktop.&nbsp; Perhaps to a dedicated folder
        you create yourself.&nbsp; You'll still be asked for permission,
        but it will be for the folder you've selected and not for your
        desktop.<br>
        <br>
        Indeed, I expect you could actually move the entire <b>VirtualAGC</b>
        app from the desktop onto any Mac OS machine of the same version
        or later as the machine on which you built it, though I have not
        tried it and do not guarantee it.<br>

    <p>I'm told that the instructions given above for Mac OS Monterey do
      not work as-is for some later versions of Mac OS, such as
      Sequoia.&nbsp; Gavin Eadie (thanks, Gavin!) has sent me modified
      instructions.&nbsp; The executive summary is that these
      instructions are the same as for Monterey, except that wxWidgets
      is built from source rather than installed via Macports.&nbsp;
      That being the case, it would be my supposition that these
      instructions should work just as well on Mac OS Monterey, Ventura,
      or Sonoma as in Sequoia, but only time will tell.<br>

    to be hard-coded into the Virtual AGC application.&nbsp; (But it can
    be changed anytime afterward by modifying the file
    VirtualAGC.app/Contents/Info.plist with a text editor.)<br>
    <br>
    Here are the steps for building Virtual AGC:<br>
    <blockquote> </blockquote>
    <ol start="1">
      <li> (One-time setup.)&nbsp; Install wxWidgets 3.2.<i>x</i>
        (currently 3.2.6) by <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/download/v3.2.6/wxWidgets-3.2.6.tar.bz2">downloading




          its source code</a>, and building it from source according to

href="https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/blob/master/docs/osx/install.md">the




          online instructions</a>.&nbsp; It might be worth rebooting
        after the build is complete.&nbsp; Building wxWidgets is simple
        when it works, but takes an extremely long time!&nbsp; And there
        are some traps to avoid:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Apparently the build does not proceed correctly if any of
          the folder names in its path contain any spaces.&nbsp; <br>
        </li>
        <li>Do <i>not</i> create an environment variable <code>cc</code>
          (as described in the next step) before building
          wxWidgets.&nbsp; If you do have such an environment variable,
          get rid of it until after building of wxWidgets is complete.</li>
        <li>It appears to me that building wxWidgets will <i>fail</i>
          if Macports has previously been used to install wxWidgets as
          described in <a moz-do-not-send="true"
            href="Newer_Macs:_Xcode_with_clang">the preceding section</a>.&nbsp;



          Or more specifically, if Macports has installed some of the
          libraries (such as libjpeg) that wxWidgets requires, because
          those libraries will be of incompatible versions.&nbsp; On
          solutions is to uninstall Macports and all of the packages
          Macports had installed.&nbsp; <a moz-do-not-send="true"
href="https://guide.macports.org/chunked/installing.macports.uninstalling.html">The



            instructions for doing so are in the Macports manual</a>,
          and it may be worth rebooting afterward.&nbsp; But if you
          can't remove Macports, and if wxWidgets doesn't build for you
          with Macports present, I'm not in a position to advise you how
          to proceed.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>(Building Virtual AGC.)&nbsp; In a shell session:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>          export cc=clang
          export CC=clang++
          git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc.git
          cd virtualagc
          make MACOSX=yes FORCE_clang=yes clean install<br></pre>
    The various <code>export</code> commands listed above make changes

    permanent.&nbsp; If the <code>bash</code> command shell is used,
    then the file you need to edit is ~/.bashrc. &nbsp; If these don't
    work for you, I'm afraid you'll have to research it yourself.<br>

    <p>This section describes installation instructions nominally for
      Windows 11, and may or may not work on other versions of Windows
      not specifically mentioned in the box above as having been
      checked.&nbsp; The build will be performed using a Linux/Mac-like
      command-line development environment called <b>MSYS2</b>, via
      Linux/Mac-like tools available in that environment.&nbsp; But the
      Virtual AGC programs produced by the build can be run directly
      from your Windows desktop without any dependence on the
      Linux/Mac-like process which created them.<br>

        Windows user (unlike myself) would prefer a build process based

        personally, but am willing to be instructed by anyone who can
        get it working and give me the exact instructions without any
        expectation that I can personally try them or debug them. I'd
        guess that there would be a much better chance for WSL than for
        Visual Studio, and that <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="#Linux">the

        already-installed environment would be advisable instead of
        installing UCRT64.&nbsp; Personally, I have not tried anything
        other than UCRT64 for building Virtual AGC, so I cannot claim
        that I know it will work.</font><br>

        going to assume that this ends up as a folder called <i>virtualagc</i>,

        instructions will be given later below.&nbsp; My personal
        suggestion would be to get it via <b>git</b>, as in the

    </blockquote>
    Having performed the one-time setup, you can build Virtual AGC via
    one of the following command sequences,<br>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>cd <i>virtualagc<br><br></i>make WIN32=yes install<br></pre>
      <i>or</i><br>
      <pre>make WIN32=yes clean install</pre>
      <i>or</i> <br>
      <pre>make cc=clang CC=clang++ WIN32=yes install</pre>
      <i>or</i><br>
      <pre>make cc=clang CC=clang++ WIN32=yes clean install</pre>
    </blockquote>
    Which particular command you choose depends on whether you prefer to
    compile using GNU <b>gcc</b>/<b>g++</b>, or whether you prefer to
    compile using <b>clang</b>/<b>clang++</b>, and on whether you have
    clutter from previous builds that you want to clear away.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    The build process just described does <i>not</i> create a desktop
    icon from which you can run the <b>VirtualAGC</b> GUI
    interface.&nbsp; Windows has changed a lot since the good old days
    when that was easy to do this and more importantly, when I <i>knew</i>
    how to do it.&nbsp; In particular, programmatically creating a
    desktop icon now apparently requires having administrative access,
    which it didn't used to, and which it doesn't on Linux or Mac
    OS.&nbsp; I don't want to mess with administrative access or
    instruct you to mess with it.<br>
    <br>
    But you can <i>manually</i> create a desktop icon yourself as
    another one-time setup, with no administrative access
    involved.&nbsp; Go figure!&nbsp; Here are the instructions for doing
    so, based on the idea that the build process described above has
    created an installation folder C:\Users\<i>username</i>\VirtualAGC.installed,







    where <i>username</i> is your personal user name (and not the
    literal string "username").&nbsp; If VirtualAGC.installed has in
    fact gone elsewhere for some reason, find it and alter the
    instructions below accordingly.<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Right-click on an empty area of the desktop and select
        New/Shortcut from the pop-up menu.</li>
      <li>You'll be prompted to enter the location of the program you're
        creating a shortcut for.&nbsp; That will be C:\Users\<i>username</i>\VirtualAGC.installed\Resources\VirtualAGC.bat.







        <br>
      </li>
      <li>At the next prompt, enter some convenient name for the
        shortcut; for example, "VirtualAGC".</li>
      <li>Nominally that completes the process, and you're ready to go!</li>
      <li>But optionally, if you want to make the icon a little
        prettier, right-click on the icon, select Properties, and hit
        the "Change Icon" button.&nbsp; I'd recommend the file C:\Users\<i>username</i>\VirtualAGC.installed\Resources\ApolloPatch2-transparent.ico.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Alternately, you can directly run the <b>VirtualAGC</b> GUI
    interface or any of the individual components of the AGC simulation
    directly from a normal Windows command line, without ever having a
    Desktop icon at all.&nbsp; Here, for example, is how to run the <b>VirtualAGC</b>
    GUI interface if you're in your "home" directory in a normal Windows
    command line:<br>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>cd VirtualAGC.installed\Resources<br>VirtualAGC.bat<br></pre>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; Incidentally, while
        I don't expect you'd have any occasion to do so, the directory
        VirtualAGC.installed mentioned above should be self-contained,
        in that it includes all executables and DLL's, so I expect you
        could probably just copy the entire directory to any Windows
        machine of the same version on which you built it or
        later.&nbsp; I have not tried that, though, so I wouldn't bet
        any money on it.</font><br>

    <p>I probably don't need to describe what <a
        href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a> is, since
      anybody interested enough in reading about how to build Virtual
      AGC for it almost certainly would know much more about it than I
      do anyway.&nbsp; Nevertheless, here's what little I do know.&nbsp;
      While WebAssembly apparently has a number of potential use cases,
      the main use case for it at present seems to be as a way to port
      applications so that they can run within a web browser ... but to
      run somewhat faster than if they were instead ported to
      JavaScript.&nbsp; Pragmatically, WebAssembly requires a browser
      which actually supports the WebAssembly virtual machine, though as
      of this writing (2021-05-26) such support is pretty widespread and
      includes Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Safari.&nbsp; <br>
    </p>
    WebAssembly builds of Virtual AGC don't provide the entire Virtual
    AGC suite of programs, but merely the AGC CPU emulation (<b>yaAGC</b>).&nbsp;














    So the idea is that you can load the WebAssembly build of <b>yaAGC</b>
    into an HTML web-page you create, along with a core-rope images of
    an AGC program, and then run the whole thing in a supporting browser
    of your choice.&nbsp; Of course, your web-page will also have to
    provide its own simulation of a DSKY or whatever other of the AGC's
    peripherals you desire.&nbsp; In principle, I suppose, you could
    build an entire CM or LM simulation within your browser.&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    However, at least a part of that is available too, but separately
    (as opposed to being in the Virtual AGC repository).&nbsp; It's
    supplied by Michael Franzl, who also created the WebAssembly port in
    the first place.&nbsp; <a
      href="https://github.com/michaelfranzl/webAGC">Michael's
      additional code (webAGC) can be found at this link.</a>&nbsp; It
    includes code for integrating webAGC into your website, and
    provides:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>A DSKY model</li>
      <li>Live views of AGC i/o ports</li>
      <li>Live view of erasable memory</li>
    </ul>
    And there's a <a
      href="https://michaelfranzl.github.io/webAGC/demo/">live demo</a>,
    so you can try it out without any additional effort.&nbsp; Any
    description I would give of Michael's live demo would likely be
    obsolete by the time you read it, but it's worth noting that (at
    least at this writing) you have to use the live demo's "load program
    into fixed memory" option first, choosing between the Luminary099
    program and the Validation program, and then you have to click the
    Run button to begin executing the AGC code.&nbsp; (Or the Step
    button instead, if you simply want to execute a single AGC
    instruction rather than to allow the AGC CPU to run freely.)&nbsp;
    Subsequently, you can use either the DSKY buttons or else the "DSKY
    key input" field to interact with the running AGC program.&nbsp;
    Luminary099 refers to the AGC program used in the Apollo 11 LM,
    while Validation is a "modern" AGC program originally written by me
    to test the simulated AGC CPU.&nbsp; Some very basic instructions
    for running <a href="index.html#Playing_with_Luminary_">Luminary099</a>
    or <a href="index.html#Running_the_Validation_Suite_">Validation</a>
    can be found on our website home page.&nbsp; <br>
    <p>Of course, for some years there has already been a JavaScript
      port of Virtual AGC: <a href="https://github.com/siravan/moonjs">moonjs</a>
      by Shahriar Iravanian (<a href="http://svtsim.com/moonjs/agc.html">live














        demo</a>), which runs the Colossus 249 AGC program (Apollo 9
      CM).&nbsp; Moonjs is based on <a href="http://asmjs.org/">a
        subset of JavaScript called asm.js</a>, which is optimized to
      allow faster-execution than arbitrarily-coded full-featured
      JavaScript programs would.&nbsp; It would be interesting some day
      to have a head-to-head speed competition between webAGC and
      moonjs, though of course if both could achieve speed parity with a
      physical AGC, then anything beyond that is gravy.&nbsp; Shahriar's
      <a href="https://github.com/siravan/moonjs#compiling">build
        instructions for moonjs</a> are pretty straightforward, and I
      won't repeat them here.&nbsp; I should note that moonjs relies on
      <a href="https://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a> to port yaAGC.c
      to asm.js, but that emscripten now seems to target WebAssembly
      rather than asm.js, so that train may have left the station!<br>
    </p>
    <p>But as far as the WebAssembly port is concerned, here's my
      interpretation of <a
        href="https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc#webassembly">Michael's














        build instructions</a> for Linux Mint 19 or later, 64-bit.&nbsp;
      The instructions won't work in Mint 17 or earlier because of
      library-versioning problems.&nbsp; First, here is the one-time
      setup:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Installation of wasi-sdk. For the sake of argument let's
        suppose the installation directory will be ~/wasi-sdk.&nbsp; You
        can simply download the prebuilt release 16 tarball:<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p><tt>cd ~/wasi-sdk<br>
              wget
https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/download/wasi-sdk-16/wasi-sdk-16.0-linux.tar.gz<br>
              tar xvf wasi-sdk-16.0-linux.tar.gz<br>
            </tt><tt>export WASI_SDK_PATH=~/wasi-sdk/wasi-sdk-16.0</tt></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    Note that although I called this a one-time setup, the environment
    variable <tt>WASI_SDK_PATH</tt> will remain set only in this
    particular instance of the command line window, and will not persist
    if you open another command line afterward.&nbsp; This lack of
    persistence only becomes a problem if you later need to compile the
    WebAssembly target for Virtual AGC again in a new command-line
    window, and hence need to set <tt>WASI_SDK_PATH</tt> again.&nbsp;
    But you may wish to permanently set this environment variable to
    avoid confusion later.<br>
    <br>
    Actually building Virtual AGC's WebAssembly target is easy:&nbsp;
    Just '<tt>cd</tt>' into Virtual AGC source directory, as obtained
    from GitHub, and then:<br>
    <blockquote><tt>cd yaAGC</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>WASI=yes make [clean] yaAGC.wasm</tt><tt><br>
      </tt></blockquote>
    The file yaAGC/yaAGC.wasm is what you actually need for your web
    page, so this is the end of the build process for Virtual AGC<br>
    <br>
    Insofar as the details of how to run an actual web page using this
    yaAGC.wasm target are concerned, if you're a web expert you probably
    don't need any additional commentary from me.&nbsp; For someone with
    a lesser level of expertise, such as myself, perhaps a few more
    words need to be said.&nbsp; I'll confine my remarks to Michael's
    demo code, which is probably what you'd want to start with if you
    were creating your own web app. <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Clone Michael's webAGC code base onto your local
        computer.&nbsp; For example, use the command "<tt>git clone
          --depth=1 https://github.com/michaelfranzl/webAGC</tt>".&nbsp;
        The subdirectory webAGC/demo/ is the top-level code for the
        web-page, webAGC/demo/agc/ contains the AGC core ropes, and the
        subdirectory webAGC/src/ contains the WebAssembly
        material.&nbsp; Specifically, the latter contains yaAGC.wasm,
        and that's where you need to copy any new yaAGC.wasm you create
        by compiling Virtual AGC.</li>
      <li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a> if you don't
        have it installed already.&nbsp; I don't know the version
        requirements, but version 8 definitely does not work.</li>
      <li>You now have to serve the webAGC/demo directory via HTTP.
        Follow the instructions in the README file of the demo
        subdirectory.</li>
    </ul>
    Now, you may wonder why there's a need to run an HTTP server at all,
    when one could simply browse to "file:///<i>PathToWebAGC</i>/demo/index.html"














    rather than to "http://localhost:8000/demo/" and seemingly avoid
    HTTP entirely?&nbsp; In other words, why can't this demo, or
    presumably similar web apps, simply run entirely within the
    browser?&nbsp; I'll simply quote what Michael has told me:<br>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
    <blockquote><font size="-1">Browsers can read files even from hard
        disk and display static websites (html, js, css) just like, say,
        a word processor displays a word document. Strictly speaking, no
        HTTP servers are required in that scenario. However, when using
        more modern browser features, like JavaScript modules,
        WebAssembly, WebRTC etc., the browser insists that content be
        served over the network. This doesn't mean that servers need to
        have any 'business logic' implemented; they can just be static
        content delivery pipes. In this sense, the&nbsp;</font><font
        size="-1"><tt>webAGC</tt></font><font size="-1">&nbsp;demo is
        indeed a pure browser/client solution; it is completely unaware
        of a server.</font><br>
    </blockquote>
    Which just reminds me of why I have always preferred <i>not</i> to
    become involved in web programming, and came away frustrated every
    time I was forced to do so.<br>

    For development snapshot 20090802 and later, it's possible to build
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span>â€”not the entire Virtual
    AGC suite, just <b>yaAGC</b>â€”from (I guess) a Mac, if you've
    downloaded an iPhone development kit.&nbsp; From the "I guess" in
    the preceding sentence, you'll probably be able to deduce that I'm
    just parrotting someone else's words and don't really know what I'm
    talking about ... and you'd be right.&nbsp; The instructions and
    mods necessary to do it came from Alberto Galdo (thanks,
    Alberto!).&nbsp; If you try it and it doesn't work, blame me for not
    implementing Alberto's instructions properly.<br>
    <br>
    To build, simply 'cd' into the yaAGC/yaAGC/ folder and do this:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> make IPHONE=yes<br>
    </div>
    <br>
    As for how useful <span style="font-weight: bold;">yaAGC</span> by
    itself is, it's obviously only marginally useful until such time as
    there's a DSKY.&nbsp; You should be able to do command-line
    debugging, however, so you could in theory run and debug AGC code.<br>

      <li>Run the <span style="font-weight: bold;">VirtualAGC</span>

      <li>Press the PRO key on the DSKY.&nbsp; The OPR ERR light will go
        off and the validation program will begin.<br>
      </li>
      <li>There is no indication that the test is running.&nbsp; The
        test takes about 77 seconds.</li>
      <li>If all tests are passed, then the PROG area on the DSKY will
        show the code "77", and the OPR ERR lamp will flash.&nbsp; (The
        return code is 77 because 77 is the largest 2-digit octal
        number.&nbsp; It is just a coincidence that the test duration is
        also 77 seconds.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>If some tests fail, an error code other than "00" or "77" will
        be displayed in the PROG area on the DSKY, and the OPR ERR lamp
        will flash.</li>
      <li>In the latter case, you can proceed from one test to the next
        by pressing the PRO key.&nbsp; The meanings of the error codes
        are determined by reading the file Validation/Validation.agc.</li>

    early-model Pi, you could find yourself using close to 100% of the
    CPU.&nbsp; For the default configuration of VirtualAGC (Lunar Module
    AGC with DSKY and Telemetry but without abort system or IMU), I find
    the following:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Pi B+:&nbsp; 80% CPU utilization.&nbsp;<br>
      </li>
      <li>Pi 3: 40% CPU utilization.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If that's too much for you, there are some things you may be able
      to do to make it more efficient.&nbsp; First, note that the
      VirtualAGC program â€” which isn't a component of the simulation,
      but merely a convenient graphical interface so that you don't have
      to memorize command-line options for the actual components â€”
      actually takes 25-30% of the CPU (for either of the two Pi models
      mentioned above) all by itself.&nbsp; You don't really need to run
      it if you don't want to.&nbsp; But how do you run a simulation
      easily without VirtualAGC?&nbsp; Well, if you run the simulation
      just <i>once</i> from VirtualAGC, and exit the simulation
      immediately after starting it, you'll find that it has
      automatically created a script called "simulate" which can be used
      to start that exact configuration of the simulation without
      running VirtualAGC itself.&nbsp; As a result, you get CPU
      utilizations closer to 50% or 10%, respectively, on the two Pi
      models mentioned above.&nbsp; To just run that script, you do
      this:</p>
    <blockquote> <tt>cd VirtualAGC/temp/lVirtualAGC/Resources</tt><tt><br>
      </tt> <tt>./simulate</tt><br>
    </blockquote>
